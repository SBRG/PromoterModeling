ECK125258878	ECK120004700	ppGpp		The nucleotides ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism.  <br>To identify transcripts regulated by ppGpp, this compound was produced by conditional expression of RelA |CITS: [30971496]|. In general, biosynthesis genes (including amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and nucleotide biosynthesis genes) responded to ppGpp induction. Many amino acid biosynthesis pathways showed increased expression, but ppGpp did not increase expression of all amino acid biosynthesis pathways to the same extent |CITS: [30971496]|.<br>Many genes involved in response to stimulus, including genes for the response to DNA damage, osmotic stress, oxidants, and environmental treatments, unexpectedly responded to ppGpp. These results suggest that ppGpp senses not only nutrition-based stresses. For example, a high percentage of cold response genes appear to be sensitive to ppGpp |CITS: [30971496]|.<br>A large number of genes related to nucleotide, protein, and RNA metabolism, translation, and DNA synthesis are negatively regulated by ppGpp. About one-half of the genes related to translation are inhibited by ppGpp induction, including genes coding for r-proteins, rRNA processing, ribosome maturation and modification enzymes, and ribosome assembly, initiation, elongation, and termination factors. Some genes coding for tRNA processing and modifying enzymes are among the most strongly ppGpp-inhibited genes |CITS: [30971496]|. Other transcripts in the central dogma category affected by ppGpp include those encoding rRNA helicases, GTPases, and chaperones needed for ribosome assembly, RNases, as well as polyamine transporters and RNA-modifying enzymes (methyltransferases, pseudouridylases, and acetyltransferases). The number of genes in the translation cetegory directly regulated more than twofold within 5 min by ppGpp is far greater than recognized previously |CITS: [30971496]|.<br>Transcription from many genes in the Energy category is activated by ppGpp. Many genes in the large Cell Exterior category are also regulated by ppGpp, including a large number of genes in the cell wall, plasma membrane, transport, and LPS metabolism groups |CITS: [30971496]|.<br>Activation observed for most ppGpp-activated promoters <i>in vivo</i> is likely to be direct |CITS: [30971496]|.<br>Although ppGpp does not bind to DNA, <i>in vitro</i> transcription analysis performed on reaction mixtures containing ppGpp and DksA (since DksA forms part of the ppGpp binding site) followed by sequence analysis of promoters regulated by this complex led to the discovery of the sequence TTGACA NNNNNNNNNNNN TGTGN TATAAT NNNNNN +1 as the consensus promoter (sequence portions in bold refer to -35 and -10 elements) |CITS: [30971496]|.<br>Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.

In addition, ppGpp coordinates cell growth in response to imbalances in outer membrane biogenesis and adenosine ribonucleotide synthesis |CITS: [30814571]|.
