It is preferable to<br>link using the DBID UNIPROT, because linking via DBID SWISSPROT<br>assumes we know that a protein is in SwissProt as opposed to TrEMBL.<br>DBID SWISSPROT is provided for backward compatibility with<br>earlier BioCyc links that use that DBID.  Because even in<br>the existing links it is possible that some links are really<br>to TrEMBL, I have changed the Common-Name slot in this frame<br>to be UniProtKB (PDK).<br>
