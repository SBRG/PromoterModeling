ECK120011186	Fis	15	inverted-repeat	EBP		ECK12	Fis, "<b>f</b>actor for <b>i</b>nversion <b>s</b>timulation", is a small DNA-binding and bending protein whose main role appears to be the organization and maintenance of nucleoid structure through direct DNA binding and by modulating gyrase |CITS: [18340041][11812843]| and topoisomerase I production |CITS: [17233826]|, as well as regulation of other proteins that modulate the nucleoid structure, such as CRP, HNS, and HU. Fis directly modulates several cellular processes, such as transcription, chromosomal replication, DNA inversion, phage integration/excision, and DNA transposition |CITS: [1484481][11278071]|. Fis is able to form topological barriers blocking supercoiling diffusion around some promoters |CITS: [31639222]|. As a transcriptional regulator, Fis regulates the expression of many genes involved in translation (rRNA and tRNA genes), virulence, biofilm formation, energy metabolism, stress response, central intermediary metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, transport, cell structure, carbon compound metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, motility, and chemotaxis |CITS: [17768236][1484481][11555281]|. A transcriptome analysis has shown that transcription of approximately 21% of genes is modulated directly or indirectly by Fis |CITS: [18340041]|. Fis, together with proteins such as HNS, HU, IHF, and Dps, is one of the largest components of the nucleoid. A ChIP-chip analysis has shown that Fis binds to 894 DNA regions in the genome, which results in two sites of Fis per supercoiling domain. These regions include both intergenic regions and regions within genes, and not all genes to which Fis binds are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to Fis in maintenance of nucleoid structure |CITS: [18340041]|. The negative supercoiling of DNA in Fis, H-NS, and HU transcription factors modulates their 3D shape and determines their molecular dynamics |CITS: [28191853]|. The circular supercoiled DNA dynamically folds in particular higher-order structures (hyperplectonemes) |CITS: [28191853]|. DNA regulated by the NAPs (HU and Fis) directly or indirectly contributes to the symmetrical wave pattern of base-pair substitution (BPS) rate |CITS: [31266871]|.   Under optimal growth conditions, Fis is the dominant DNA-binding protein in the cell. Up to 60,000 copies of the protein can be found in a single cell under log phase, but it is nearly imperceptible in stationary phase (<100 molecules per cell) |CITS: [10515926]|. The binding of FIS along the DNA positively correlates with transcriptional propensity |CITS: [30904377]|. The main effect of FIS on high transcription appears to be on the chromosomal integration region instead of an effect on specific promoters to which it binds |CITS: [30904377]|. Fis bends the DNA between 40 and 90&deg; |CITS: [1484481]|. This bending stabilizes the DNA looping to regulate transcription and to promote DNA compaction |CITS: [17045294][9642081]|.   The crystal structure of Fis has been solved by several research groups |CITS: [11183780][1946369][1986310][9362499]|, and they have shown that this protein has an &alpha;-helical core of four helices (A to D). The C-terminal domain contains the C and D helices, forming a helix-turn-helix motif, characteristic of many DNA-binding proteins. The N-terminal domain has the A helix and a flexible &beta;-hairpin arm, which are involved in DNA inversion; this region appears to make contact with the DNA invertase Hin in the invertasome structure |CITS: [9362499][1484481]|.  As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, expression of <i>fis</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, Fis is autoregulated, induced by high supercoiling levels |CITS: [11029698]|, and regulated by both growth rate-dependent and stringent control systems that require the presence of a GC motif downstream of the -10 region |CITS: [1547773]|.  The growth and the net final biomass produced in a <i>fis</i> single deletion mutant strain growing under anaerobic fermentation conditions were affected relative to responses of the wild-type strain (<i>Escherichia coli</i> strain BW 25113) grown in the same conditions |CITS: [28573283]|. Deletion of global transcription regulators such as Fnr, ArcA, IHF, CRP, and Fis under anaerobic fermentation conditions increased the glucose uptake rate above that required for the observed growth rate. In addition, higher ATP synthesis and redox balance rates were reported relative to the observed growth rate and biomass yield |CITS: [29748694]|.  Transcription of <i>fis</i> is also regulated by the availability of the nucleotide triphosphate CTP, which is the nucleotide with which transcription of <i>fis</i> is initiated and whose largest concentration is seen during log phase, a fact that correlates with the pattern of <i>fis</i> expression. If transcription of this gene is initiated with an A or a G instead of a C, transcription is induced at the same level in early stationary phase rather than in log phase |CITS: [15385561]|.   A promoter that does not transcribe any ORF is located upstream of the promoter that transcribes <i>fis</i> and in the opposite direction. Under RNA polymerase limitation, both promoters compete for the protein. This might be a type of <i>fis</i> regulation expression, but there is no evidence to support this claim |CITS: [11279109]|.  DksA, a protein that is associated with RNA polymerase in regulating transcription, inhibits transcription of <i>fis</i> by increasing the inhibitory effects of ppGpp, decreasing the lifetime of the RNA polymerase-<i>fis</i> promoter complex, and increasing the sensitivity to the CTP nucleotide |CITS: [16885445]|.  In a specific way and with tight binding affinity, Fis recognizes and binds as a dimer to sites that have poorly related sequences. However, a very degenerated consensus sequence has been proposed for Fis sites, with only a subset of common nucleotides. This consensus sequence shows a core binding site of 15 bp with partial dyad symmetry |CITS: [1484481]|. This sequence presents only four highly conserved nucleotides, a G and a C at the 1st and at the 15th nucleotide, respectively, and a pyrimidine (A or G) and a purine (T or C) at the 5th and 11th positions, respectively. The central region commonly presents an AT-rich sequence |CITS: [18178221][9396807]|. Some of these sites have internal sequences that are potential methylation targets, 5'-GATC-3', suggesting that under some circumstances Fis binding is controlled by methylation |CITS: [1320613]|. The binding of Fis is destabilized when the tension of the double helix increases |CITS: [21427084]|.  The intrinsic curvature and flexibility of binding sites of Fis were investigated. Fis prefers high curvature with very little fluctuation at the binding regions (compared with the flanking regions), indicating that the intrinsic curvature may positively contribute to Fis' binding affinity |CITS: [29625128]|.   Fis undergoes facilitated dissociation (FD) from single binding sites formed from short DNAs, and the off-rate saturates at high Fis concentrations in solution |CITS: [28364020]|.  Based on proteomic studies, it was determined that the activities of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) such as  H-NS, HU, IHF, and FIS are also modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that signal differences in growth conditions; because none of the NAPs are known to bind any signaling ligands, these growth condition signals may be compensated for by these PTMs |CITS: [30287510]|.  FIS is less subject to functional modulation by PTM than the other NAPs |CITS: [30287510]|, and its  expression is much more dependent on growth phase and growth rate |CITS: [26208826]|. Based on computational analysis, it was determined that the Fis1:Fis2:DNA ternary complex contains a binary Fis molecular dyad whose formation relies on complex structural rearrangements. On the other hand, this analysis also allowed distinction of several different pathways for the dissociation of the protein from DNA with different functional outcomes and involving different protein stoichiometries, showing that the existence of multiple binding configurations of transcription factors have a significant impact on the kinetics and outcome of dissociation from DNA, with important implications for the systems biology of gene regulation by Fis |CITS: [31566963]|.  The importance of indirect readout for the nucleosome as well as of the bacterial regulators Fis and CRP was determined by using the software ThreaDNA. ThreaDNA can be used to predict the contribution of DNA deformations for the sequence selectivity of proteins |CITS: [29444234]|.  Based on synthetic promoter variants harboring consensus cis-elements, it was demonstrated that both Fis and IHF can recognize the consensus binding site  of the other. However, changing this arrangement of the cis-elements can completely abolish the nonspecific binding of both. Combining cis-elements for both TFs could result in Fis and IHF repressed or activated promoters, depending on the final architecture of the promoters, in an unpredictable way |CITS: [32626694]|.  Under ampicillin treatment, the activity of FIS appears to increase |CITS: [33731833]|.  Fis appears to be damaged by the inner membrane that contains accumulation of the unprocessed outer membrane |FRAME:CPLX0-8279 | Lpp (pro-Lpp), causing the arrest of cellular growth, which is restored with a <i>fis</i> deletion mutant  |CITS: [34163454]|.

ECK120011190	Rob	20	asymmetric	AraC/XylS		ECK12	Rob is a transcriptional dual regulator. Its N-terminal domain shares 49% identity with MarA and SoxS |CITS:[8383113]|. These proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes |CITS:[10852879][12067348][14712652][11395452]|, the <i>marA/soxS/rob</i> regulon, involved in antibiotic resistance |CITS:[8636021][15853893][7896685]|, superoxide resistance |CITS:[8626315][1400156][1317841]|, and tolerance to organic solvents |CITS:[9324261][9783171][30976323]| and heavy metals |CITS:[7793951]|. The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS:[11844771][12791142]|, and the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate |CITS:[11395452]| and oxidative stress |CITS:[8955629]|, respectively. Cross talk between the <i>mar</i> and <i>rob</i> systems plays an important role in the response to salicylate |CITS:[22753060]|.   Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS:[14594836]|.   Rob, MarA, and SoxS bind as monomers to the same DNA site, a degenerate 20-bp sequence known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the  -35 and  -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|. In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the  -35 box and are generally oriented in the backward direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the  -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS:[10564485][10564484][22465792]|. As a subset of the class I promoters, the Mar-Sox-Rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the  -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|.  The Mar-Sox-Rob box contains an "invariant A" at position 1, two recognition elements, the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS:[10802742][11724537][11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS:[11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS:[11985714]|. It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named "DNA scanning" or "prerecruitment." In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites |CITS:[11985714][11866462]|.   Rob consists of two domains and belongs to the AraC/XylS family |CITS:[9409145]|. The N-terminal domain is the DNA-binding domain and is homologous to MarA and SoxS and the C-terminal domain of AraC. It carries two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs for DNA binding. One of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the Mar-Sox-Rob box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with RE2 |CITS:[12217688][9724717][11724537]|. In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of the two HTH motifs makes base-specific contacts with DNA |CITS:[10802742]|. In order to decipher molecular details of the free and DNA-bound forms of Rob and MarA, some simulation analysis using native and mutant DNA binding sites and proteins has been performed |CITS: [34137249]|. On the other hand, the crystal structures of Rob |CITS:[10802742]| and MarA |CITS:[9724717]| in complex with DNA and the solution structure of the DNA-binding domain of AraC |CITS:[19422057]| have been solved.  The C-terminal domain of Rob is similar to a portion of the enzyme GalT |CITS:[10802742]|. It regulates the activity of Rob by a "sequestration-disposal" mechanism, that is, it mediates the sequestration of Rob into intracellular foci. Sequestered Rob is inactive. Upon addition of the inducer, Rob is released in its active form |CITS:[19289129]|. The C-terminal domain blocks in addition proteolytic degradation by Lon protease |CITS:[19289129]|.  <i>rob</i> appears to be transcribed abundantly at 5,000-10,000 molecules per cell |CITS:[8449900][10515926]|, throughout the growth cycle. <i>rob</i> expression is enhanced at the stationary phase and under glucose and phosphate starvation, and it was suggested that expression of rob is &sigma;<sup>S</sup> dependent |CITS:[7476863]|.   The Rob transcription factor modified <i>in vivo</i> in the presence of  nucleobase amino acids at position 40 exhibited enhanced DNA promoter binding as well as phenotypic changes including resistance to antibiotics |CITS:[32157864]|.   The replacement of Arg90 with purine nucleobase amino acids increases the affinity of Rob for its DNA binding site and results in moderate phenotypic changes in resistance to antibiotics and HgCl<sub>2</sub> |CITS: [32412234]|.  The inactivation of Rob provokes changes in the expression of 285 genes and causes greater tolerance to butanol |CITS: [33072717]|.  In cells induced for chlorhexidine (CHX) resistance, expression levels of |FRAME: EG10958| and <i>rob</i> are decreased |CITS: [34095221]|.  Reviews: |CITS:[10498949][8955629][12027588]|.

Rob consists of two domains and belongs to the AraC/XylS family <a title="9409145" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gallegos MT,1997</a> The N-terminal domain is the DNA-binding domain and is homologous to MarA and SoxS and the C-terminal domain of AraC.

ECK120011194	TyrR	18	inverted-repeat	EBP		ECK12	 TyrR, "<b>tyr</b>osine <b>r</b>epressor," is the dual transcriptional regulator of the TyrR regulon |CITS:[4887504][4399341][15612913]|. The TyrR regulon involves genes that are essential for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and transport. TyrR can act both as a repressor and as an activator of transcription at &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters |CITS:[1943694]|.  TyrR is a homodimer in solution. In the presence of tyrosine and ATP it self-associates to form a hexamer |CITS:[8176727][11923293]|. TyrR consists of three functional domains, an N-terminal domain (aa 1-190), a central domain (aa 206-433), and a C-terminal domain (aa 444-513). The structure of the N-terminal domain has been solved |CITS:[17222426]|. It contains both an ACT and a PAS domain and is responsible for the activation functions of TyrR. The central domain carries an AAA+ domain typical for enhancer-binding proteins |CITS:[12018490]|. This domain is responsible for the binding and hydrolysis of ATP and for the ATP-dependent binding of the aromatic amino acid cofactors. In addition it possesses a phosphatase activity that is stimulated by zinc ions and inhibited by L-tyrosine and ATP |CITS:[10648532]|. The central domain is responsible for the repressor functions of TyrR and contains determinants important for the hexamerization |CITS:[11923293]|. The C-terminal domain carries a classic HTH motif and is involved in DNA binding and dimerization |CITS:[8449883][11344327]|.  TyrR binds specifically to an 18-bp palindromic target sequence, the Tyr box |CITS:[3525516][ 1943694]|. TyrR binds to strong boxes in the absence of any cofactors. Binding to weak boxes requires ATP, tyrosine, or in the case of <i>tyrB</i> tyrosine or phenylalanine, and an adjacent strong box |CITS:[1943694][12207706]|. TyrR can act as a transcriptional activator and repressor. Repression requires ATP-dependent binding of aromatic amino acids to the central domain with one exception: <i>tyrR</i> represses its own transcription without additional cofactors. Tyrosine is the major effector of TyrR-mediated repression. Some repression occurs with phenylalanine as a cofactor in the case of <i>aroF</i> |CITS:[4399341]|, <i>aroL</i> |CITS:[7961453]|, <i>tyrP</i> and <i>aroP</i> |CITS:[334742]|, and <i>aroG</i> |CITS:[2861143]| or with tryptophan as a cofactor for <i>aroL</i> |CITS:[7961453]| and <i>aroP</i> |CITS:[334742]|. The residues 173, 160, and 184 of TyrR appear to be necessary to recognize the ligand L-phenylalanine (L-Phe). It was speculated that the residues 173 and 160 bind to L-Phe through hydrogen bonds and that residue 185 provides space for the benzene ring of L-Phe |CITS: [30680497]|.   TyrR-mediated activation appears to involve non ATP-dependent binding of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan to the N-terminal domain of TyrR and the binding of TyrR to a strong box located upstream of the -35 region of the promoter.  TyrR activates transcription by interacting with the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of the RNA polymerase |CITS:[7798138][34309399]|. The important residues for activation by TyrR are D250 and R310 of RpoA and R77, D97, K101, D118, E119, R121, E141 S95, E139, S100,  and D103 of TyrR located in the N-terminal domain |CITS:[34309399]|.

ECK120011202	ArgP	20		LysR		ECK12	ArgP, for "<b>arg</b>inine <b>p</b>rotein," controls the transcription of genes involved in the arginine transport system and genes involved in DNA replication. DNA replication is also regulated directly by ArgP when the protein binds to three 13-mers located in the origin of replication (OriC), which blocks the DNA opening by DnaA and inhibits this cellular process |CITS:[2034653][2208289][1733927]|. DNA binding by ArgP is prevented when the serine protease Do (DegP) hydrolyzes this transcriptional regulator |CITS: [8335089]|.  ArgP was first identified as an inhibitor of <i>oriC</i>-initiated DNA replication <i>in vitro</i>. It has also subsequently been described as a nucleoid-associated protein that shows apparently sequence-nonspecific DNA-binding activity |CITS:[10551881]|.  ArgP is a noncanonical regulator, as it binds to a number of additional sites in the genome without an apparent direct regulatory effect, exhibiting low-affinity binding to these additional sites |CITS:[21890697][1733927][ 21441513]|.  To activate transcription, ArgP recognizes AT-rich DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. However, recent studies showed that the operator for ArgP consists of two subsites, each one being most likely contacted by two ArgP subunits, and there is sequence specificity of ArgP binding, with a half-site consensus sequence, 5-CTTAT-, involved in effector-free ArgP binding |CITS:[29146251]|. On the other hand, the alternative binding site (ABS'; T-N<sub>11</sub>-A from 47 to 37) in the <i>argO</i> operator is preferentially bound in the presence of arginine and it is crucial for transcription activation |CITS:[29146251]|.  ArgP induces bending on argO and lysP operators with angles of approximately 60    and 56 , respectively, and without significant differences in the absence versus presence of arginine or lysine |CITS:[29146251]|.  When this protein activates genes involved in replication, it appears to bind to their regulatory regions without a coeffector |CITS: [9254708][9819053]|. However, the activity of ArgP depends on arginine and lysine to regulate genes involved in arginine metabolism. These amino acids, which bind to ArgP, do not seem to help the protein to form dimers or to bind to DNA, but they contribute to recruitment of the RNA polymerase and in forming the open complex. However, only the ArgP-arginine complex can produce transcripts, whereas ArgP-lysine appears to inhibit transcription |CITS: [17504942][15150242]|. Lysine greatly reduces ArgP-mediated activation of the ArgP regulon and counteracts the positive effect of arginine on <i>argO</i> transcription. Effector-free ArgP is the active form of the regulator for all regulon members, except activation of <i>argO</i>, which is strictly arginine dependent |CITS:[29146251]|.  ArgP is a dimer with an estimated concentration of 100 to 400 molecules per cell (that is, around 200 to 800 nM monomers) |CITS:[10515926][1733927]|.

Members of the LysR family that show considerable homology to ArgP include AmpR from <i>Citrobacter freundii</i>, MetR from <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serotype Typhimurium, and NhaR from <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> <a title="2034653" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Thony B,1991</a>.

The expression of <i>argP</i> is induced by PhoB under phosphate starvation <a title="10589831" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Han JS,1999</a>. Contrary to the suggestion made by <a title="10600368" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Celis RT.,1999</a>, <a title="15150242" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Nandineni MR,2004</a> suggested that <i> argP</i> is not autoregulated.

Activation and repression by ArgP are differentially controlled by protein-DNA contacts <a title="29146251" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Nguyen Le Minh P,2018</a>

ArgP is also called IciA ( for "<b>i</b>nhibitor of <b>c</b>hromosome <b>i</b>nitiation") <a title="2034653" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Thony B,1991</a>.
ECK120011210	CpxR	15		OmpR		ECK12	The regulatory protein CpxR appears to control at least 100 operons |CITS: [11953442]|. Some of these operons are involved in cellular functions, such as "<b>c</b>onjugative <b>p</b>lasmid gene e<b>x</b>pression" (cpx) |CITS: [6998969][18069965]|, the envelope stress response system, pilus assembly, secretion, motility and chemotaxis, adherence, biofilm development, multidrug resistance and efflux |CITS: [16487683]|, and the copper-responsive regulatory system |CITS: [16861804]|, among others. In pathogenic bacteria it controls genes involved in invasion of host cells |CITS: [15882407]|. Sometimes, CpxR acts to modulate the action of the main activators or repressors of some promoters |CITS: [16487683]|.  The strong transcription activation by CpxR appears to be carried out by stabilization and acceleration of the RNApol, but the weak activation could be due to stabilization of RNApol and the slow rate of promoter escape |CITS:[34758318]|.    CpxR is the response regulator in the two-component regulatory system comprised of CpxR and CpxA |CITS: [8294007]|. Autophosphorylation of CpxA is stimulated by multiple stimuli, such as alkaline pH, altered membrane lipid composition, interaction with hydrophobic surfaces, and high osmolarity, among others |CITS: [16487683]|. NlpE, an outer membrane lipoprotein, when overexpressed also stimulates the activity of CpxA |CITS: [7635808]| and is required for the activation of CpxA in response to adherence to hydrophobic surfaces |CITS: [11830644]| or external copper ions |CITS: [7635807]|, or in the presence of oxidative folding defects |CITS: [30833359]|. When the C-terminal domain of NlpE does not contain a disulfide bond, the N-terminal domain of NlpE appears to interact directly with the periplasmic domain of CpxA to turn on the cpx system |CITS: [30833359]|.  The autokinase activity of CpxA is inhibited by CpxP, a small periplasmic protein that binds to the periplasmic domain of CpxA |CITS: [17259177]|. This small protein is degraded in turn by the protease DegP in response to PapE/PapG misfolding or to alkaline pH |CITS: [16166523][16303867]|. CpxR activates both the <i>cpxP</i> and <i>degP</i> genes |CITS: [16861804]|.  When CpxA is phosphorylated, its phosphate group is transferred to CpxR to activate it |CITS: [9401031]|. CpxA is also able to dephosphorylate to CpxR, and it has been suggested that this activity is the default status of CpxA in the absence of strong stress signals |CITS: [18223085]|.   On the other hand, CpxR also can be active without activation by CpxA. The PTA-ACK pathway, which converts acetyl-CoA to acetyl-P, ATP, and acetate, activates the CpxR protein without CpxA in response to signals associated with growth and central metabolism |CITS: [18223085]|. AcP also functions as a phosphoryl donor to CpxR, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in <i>cpxP</i> repression.  Acetylation of the lysine residue Lys-298 on the surface of the RNAP &alpha;-CTD contributes to promoter activity, and Lys-291 deadens this activation; it also requires Asp-51 of CpxR |CITS: [22829598][26790713]|. The conversion of Lys-291 to Gln(&alpha;K29Q), a mimic for acetylation of lysine residue Lys-291 of the RNAP &alpha;-CTD, affects the transcription of <i>cpxP</i> |CITS: [26790713]|. Z nucleotides [ZMP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-monophosphate) and/or ZTP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-triphosphate)] can also act as direct phosphodonors to CpxR <i>in vivo</i>, activating it in a CpxA-independent manner |CITS: [33318202]|.  <i>In vitro</i> analysis, to explore cross-talk among proteins of two-component systems, shows that CpxR can dephosphorylate five-histidine kinases, other than CpxA, of two-component systems. However, no kinase other than CpxA is able to phosphorylate CpxR |CITS: [16487683]|.  CpxR, like the members of the OmpR subfamily to which it pertains, has a receiver domain at the N terminus and a DNA-binding domain at the C terminus |CITS: [11226872]|. The proteins of this family appear to function as dimers |CITS: [17545283]|. They recognize and bind inverted repeats or tandem sequence in DNA. The CpxR box consists of two tandemly organized pentamers separated by 4-8 bp |CITS: [16861804][11953442]|.  The catalytic core domains of the Cpx system have been reported |CITS: [24492262][28552574]|. Based on combined techniques, CpxR can adopt both open and closed states in solution and in its unphosphorylated form |CITS: [30086390]|. At 5 &Aring; resolution, it was determined that CpxR dimerizes through its &alpha;1-&alpha;5 surface, in addition to the canonical &alpha;4-&beta;5-&alpha;5 dimerization interface |CITS: [30086390]|.   In addition to Cpx, the systems specifically involved in envelope stress specifically are the Bae system and RpoE stress response system |CITS: [12354228][10322173]|. The Cpx system is connected to the regulatory networks of RpoH, RpoE, and RpoS. They are sigma factors that are also involved in the stress response. CpxR increases the expression of RpoH and decreases RpoE expression |CITS: [16952953][11953442]|. Its expression is increased by RpoS during stationary phase |CITS: [10542180]|. Cpx system regulates and is regulated by small noncoding RNAs via a feed-forward loop among its feedback mechanisms |CITS: [25246476]|.  The Cpx system is an important element in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and there is a relationship between reactive (ROS), the Cpx system, and EGCG-mediated cell death. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) induces a disturbance in the cell envelope that activates the Cpx system. Analysis of a <i>cpxR</i> deletion strain, it was identified a constant ROS level and a notable increase in the survival rate of mutants <i>cpxR</i> mutants, while the ROS level increased and the survival rate decreased remarkably in the wild-type strain |CITS: [29497416]|.  EGCG induces ROS formation by activating the Cpx system and mediates cell death; it also increases the resistance to ampicillin through the Cpx system |CITS: [29497416]|.  CpxR is not an essential protein |CITS: [32108145]|.  The <i>cpxA</i> and <i>cpxR</i> genes are located together in the genome and appear to be transcribed in the same operon.

ECK120011229	FNR	14	inverted-repeat	CRP		ECK12	FNR is the primary transcriptional regulator that mediates the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth through the regulation of hundreds of genes. Generally, this protein activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism |CITS: [12754220][15659690][32955440]|. FNR also regulates the transcription of many genes with other functions, such as acid resistance, chemotaxis, cell structure, and molecular biosynthesis, among others |CITS: [12754220][15659690]|.  The cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth |CITS: [15547274]|, but its activity is regulated directly by oxygen. A binding signature from FNR was observed only in low oxygen conditions |CITS: [32955440]|. Under anaerobiosis, FNR acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster that causes a conformational change and dimerization of the protein that causes it to become activated |CITS: [11581261]|. Purification of [4Fe-4S]-FNR in an O<sub>2</sub>-free environment has been described |CITS: [19892202]|. The presence of O<sub>2</sub> results in inactivation of FNR via oxidation of this [4Fe-4S] cluster into a [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [19261852][15547274][9177174]| and the disassembly of the dimer |CITS: [8576252]|. After prolonged O<sub>2</sub> exposure, the [2Fe-2S] cluster is destroyed, and apo-FNR, which lacks an Fe-S cluster, is the primary form of FNR under aerobiosis |CITS: [18055593][14730984]|. Nitric oxide (NO) is also able to inactivate FNR through the nitrosylation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, although NO is sensed by other transcription factors, and FNR appears only to function as a final safeguard against NO damage |CITS: [23471974][12093725]|. The phylogenetic relationship of the [4Fe-4S]-containing O<sub>2</sub> sensor was analyzed in bacteria |CITS: [30225854]|.  Based on mass spectrometry, intermediates between the O<sub>2</sub>-driven [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] conversion, such as [3Fe-3S] and [2Fe-2S](S)<sub>n</sub>, have been identified |CITS: [28373574]|. Kinetic data showed that cluster sulfide oxidation occurred in parallel with cluster conversion |CITS: [28373574]|.  The accumulation of the protein FNR is slightly increased during iron-limiting conditions |CITS: [31235512]|.  Under ampicillin treatment, the activity of FNR appears to increase |CITS: [33731833]|.  Under aerobiosis, the apo-FNR monomer is exposed and can be degraded by the ClpXP protease |CITS: [16243354]|. Two motifs of FNR appear to be necessary for this degradation, one located  in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal region |CITS: [16243354]|.  The activated FNR conformation is able to bind a specific palindromic sequence of DNA  with the consensus sequence TTGATNNNNATCAA |CITS: [11771123][2677602]|. The G and the first T of each FNR half-site appears to interact with FNR residues Glu-209 and Ser-212 |CITS: [2136332]|. FNR activates the transcription from class I and class II promoters, in which the FNR-binding sites are located  around -61, -71, -82, or -92 in class I and around -41.5 in class II |CITS: [7592457]|.  In class I promoters the second N and in class II promoters the third N of the consensus FNR site tend to be an A-T |CITS: [12706827]|.  During activation, three activating regions (AR) are surface exposed for contact with the polymerase and promote transcription. The AR1 region contacts with the &alpha; subunit |CITS: [10972822]|, the AR2 region makes contact with the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> |CITS: [12374818]|, and the AR3 contacts the &alpha; NTD of the RNA polymerase |CITS: [11786011]|. The group amino acids Thr-118 with Ser-187; Lys-49 with Lys50; and Asp86 and Ile81 with Gly-85 are important for AR1, AR2, and AR3, respectively, to make contact with the RNA polymerase |CITS: [10972822][12374818][11786011]|. The monomer in the FNR dimer that makes contact with the RNA polymerase and the activating region in FNR that makes the contact depends on the class of promoter, class I or class II |CITS: [10972822][12374818][11786011]|.  FNR belongs to the CRP/FNR superfamily of transcription factors whose members are widely distributed in bacteria |CITS: [14638413]|.  These proteins have an N-terminal sensory domain, a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization motif in between |CITS: [14638413]|. The sensory domain of FNR contains five cysteine residues, four of which are essential for linking the [4Fe-4S] cluster |CITS: [8497198]|.   The intrinsic curvature and flexibility of binding sites of FNR were investigated. FNR showed higher levels of intrinsic curvature than the NAPs, such as IHF, H-NS, Fis, and Dps, and this curvature of binding sites is independent of the sequence-level conservation |CITS: [29625128]|. The binding sites for FNR have high intrinsic curvature compared with flanking regions, and these are characterized by high structural flexibility  |CITS: [29625128]|.  Under anaerobic growth conditions, transcription of the <i>fnr</i> gene is negatively autoregulated |CITS: [17293415]|. The growth |CITS:[33785570][28573283]| and the net final biomass produced in an <i>fnr</i> single deletion mutant strain growing under anaerobic fermentation conditions were affected relative to responses of the wild-type strain (<i>Escherichia coli</i> strain BW25113) grown in the same conditions |CITS: [28573283]|.The <i>fnr </i> mutant also caused decreased nucleotide synthesis, decreased glucose and ammonia uptake rates, and enhanced nitrogen transport and accumulation of amino acids and their precursors, as well as derepression of aerobic TCA cycle and alternate carbon metabolic proteins |CITS:[33785570]|. The activities of some transcription factors appear to be enhanced (ArgR, NtrC, NrdR) or diminished (PuuR) in the fnr mutant |CITS:[33785570]|. |CITS: [29748694]| et al. reported a relative increase in the glucose uptake rate above that required for the observed growth rate. In addition, higher ATP synthesis and redox balance rates were reported relative to the observed growth rate and biomass yield in the mutant |CITS: [29748694]|.  FNR was named for the mutant defect in "<b>f</b>umarate and <b>n</b>itrate <b>r</b>eduction" |CITS: [796407]|.  <i>fnr</i> mutants, also known as type III mutants, had originally been given the locus name <i>frdB</i> |CITS: [773363]|.  A new variant of FNR, (FNRD154A)<sub>2</sub>, was used to identify FNR interactions on the <i>ydfZ</i> promoter region |CITS: [22326866]|.  (FNRD154A)<sub>2</sub> also recognizes an FNR-dependent promoter under aerobic conditions and maintains its promoter specificity and conformational stability.  This variant was designed with enhanced stability to O<sub>2</sub>.  It could have a major impact on <i>in vitro</i> verification of the vast numbers of previously unrecognized genes in the FNR regulon, especially in genomic studies |CITS: [22326866]|.  Using  information available in EcoCyc and RegulonDB, 393 CRP feed-forward loops (FFLs) were identified. Microarray analyses revealed dynamic gene expression of each target in response to a range of cAMP dosages; eight types of FFLs were identified, and they were divided into five functional groups |CITS: [30096859]|.  A variation at the F186 residue of FNR (F1861) causes a reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced resistance to ionizing radiation under chronic exposure conditions |CITS: [30673695]|. The transcription of FNR-activatable promoters is reduced with the FNR variant  (F1861) under reduced oxygen, and cellular growth is enhanced in rich medium in the presence of the variant F1861|CITS: [30673695]|.

The cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth <a title="15547274" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Sutton VR, Mettert EL, Beinert H, Kiley PJ,2004</a>, but its activity is regulated directly by oxygen.

ECK120011250	CadC		inverted-repeat	OmpR		ECK12	CadC is a metal-sensitive transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of genes involved in cadaverine synthesis and excretion under low external pH and high concentrations of lysine |CITS: [1370290][8195083][16491024]|.  Two binding sites for CadC, Cad1 and Cad2, have been determined in the <i>cadBA</i> operon. While Cad1 contains an inverted repeat sequence and has a  preference for AT-rich regions |CITS: [28432336]|, Cad2 lacks either an inverted repeat or a palindromic sequence. Both binding sites are necessary for <i>cadBA</i> activation. Under aerobic conditions, H-NS represses the <i>cadBA</i> operon. Upon binding to Cad1, CadC releases bound H-NS molecules, dissolving the H-NS repressor complex and allowing RNA polymerase binding. Transcription of <i>cadBA</i> is finally activated once a molecule of CadC binds to Cad2 |CITS: [16491024]|.  CadC is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the ToxR-like family of transcriptional activators. It features a cytoplasmic DNA-binding N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a periplasmic C-terminal domain |CITS: [16491024]|. Based on two-hybrid analysis, CadC forms stable dimers in a stimulus- and linker-dependent manner, interacting only at pH 6.8; in addition, lysine is required for transducing the pH-dependent response of the periplasmic sensor into a structural rearrangement that facilitates dimerization of the cytoplasmic CadC DNA-binding domain |CITS: [25979249]|. The localization of CadC molecules in DNA, visible as clusters, is a result of a diffusion/capture mechanism dependent on the DNA |CITS: [30740540]|.The mean search time of CadC to its DNA binding site was measured to be on average 4.5 min, regardless of the position on the chromosome of that site |CITS: [33539417]|. This search time decreased by a factor of two when a second site was introduced in the chromosome, which is consistent with the 2D diffusion and capture mechanism |CITS: [33539417]|.  Based on mutational analysis, amino acids in the CadC DNA-binding domain (DBD) that are important for DNA recognition and function were identified. CadC utilizes non-sequence-specific and only a few specific interactions for complex formation |CITS:[ 28432336]|.  In the absence of lysine, LysP regulates CadC negatively |CITS: [8195083][30740540]|. This inhibition is through intramembrane and periplasmic contacts under noninducing conditions. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, Asp275 and Asp278 in LysP and Arg265 and Arg268 in CadC were identified as residues for the stimulus-dependent interaction between them |CITS: [24056175]|.  LysP and CadC interact most strongly at pH7.6 and at lysine concentrations of 1 &micro;M or less, that is, under non-Cad-inducing conditions. This interaction is attenuated under Cad-inducing conditions (low pH, increased lysine levels). The LysP-CadC interaction is mediated via trans-membrane and periplasmic contacts |CITS: [24056175]|. Oligomerization of LysP is induced at low pH |CITS: [24056175]|. LysP is a trigger transporter |CITS: [19708919]|, i.e., a protein that combines regulation and transport functions within the one polypeptide.  At neutral cytoplasmic pH, a disulfide bond is formed in the periplasmic domain of CadC to inactivate it. At low pH, formation of the disulfide bond is prevented, which in turn converts CadC into an active state, but only if lysine is present to inactivate to LysP, the negative regulator of CadC |CITS: [21486484]|.  Phylogenetic analysis revealed a higher complexity and more regulatory elements for the Cad system in <i>E. coli</i> than for that in <i>Vibrio campbellii</i> |CITS:[32482722]|.  The crystal structure of the CadC DNA-binding domain (DBD) has been determined |CITS:[ 28432336]|.  CadC appears to have a modest role in bacterial triclosan resistance |CITS: [33945454]|.

ECK120011294	H-NS	15	inverted-repeat	HNS		ECK12	The H-NS protein, for "<b>H</b>istone-like <b>n</b>ucleoid <b>s</b>tructuring protein," is a nucleoid-associated multifunctional protein that is capable of condensing |CITS: [10982869]| and supercoiling DNA |CITS: [16384714][15853876][11282470][8306968]|. It is a global transcriptional silencer of genes with high AT content |CITS: [15100692][18387844]|, regulates 5% of all <i>Escherichia coli</i> genes |CITS: [11298273]|, and plays a key role in global chromosome organization in bacteria |CITS: [21903814]|. This protein acts as a pleiotropic transcriptional factor with a strong preference for horizontally acquired genes among the 250 loci to which it binds |CITS: [2126011][17046956][31960057]|. H-NS functions almost exclusively as a transcriptional repressor, although there is no clear evidence that this regulator is an activator. Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature, although Reush et al. proposed that this regulator can form a complex with a short chain of polyhydroxybutyrate |CITS: [12220682]|. Additional genes might be identified by high-throughput analysis |CITS: [19151137]|.  H-NS suppresses transcription initiation at many intragenic sites as well as transcription of non-coding RNAs genome-wide |CITS: [24449106]|, such as antisense RNAs located in regions enriched with RNA polymerase-binding RNA aptamers (RAPs) |CITS: [31535128]|.   H-NS plays an important role in the regulation of many genes in response to environmental changes and adaptation to stress; therefore, it is  capable of controlling its own synthesis |CITS: [7934818][8830277]|. It also regulates transcription of many other genes that participate in a variety of cellular functions, including genes involved in the following processes or responses: biogenesis of flagella |CITS: [8071234][10601207][11872702]|, transcription control of the type I fimbria structural genes |CITS: [9922259][9352908][9595659][7510658][9749677]|, acid resistance  |CITS: [16204188]|, the functional glutamic acid-dependent system |CITS: [10383761]|, osmotically inducible genes |CITS: [9663683]|, the glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance system |CITS: [15795232][12446650][11976288][11298273]|, osmotic control |CITS: [8120010][11673423]|, the type II secretion pathway |CITS: [11118204]|, carbon sources |CITS: [2160266]|, genes involved in the RNA component of the small subunit (30S subunit) |CITS: [9632265][15686546]|, and proteases |CITS: [16143461]|, among others. It has also been shown to be involved in survival during stationary phase, conferring to the bacteria a growth advantage during stationary phase (GASP) |CITS: [22843842]|. A lack of H-NS results in overexpression of <i>ycdT</i>, <i>ydeH</i>, <i>yeal</i>, <i>yeaJ</i>, <i>yaiC</i>, <i>csgD</i>, <i>iraP</i>, and <i>ydiV</i>, while expression of <i>fliA</i> is decreased. These results indicate that H-NS influences motility via multiple regulatory linkages that include, minimally, the messenger molecule cyclic di-GMP, the biofilm regulatory protein CsgD, and the sigma factors &sigma;<sup>S</sup> and &sigma;<sup>F</sup>, thus impacting motility through diverse regulatory pathways |CITS: [26195595]|.  H-NS is capable of inducing severe bends in the DNA, interacting with a large number of DNA regions that contain a planar curvature |CITS: [2126011][1745240][14627810]|. It has been suggested that H-NS binds strongly to sites carrying a 10-bp AT-rich consensus sequence, which functions as a nucleation site for the formation of a repressive higher-order nucleoprotein complex |CITS: [17881364][19740756]|. That AT-rich sequence for H-NS DNA binding is preferred for insertion of horizontally acquired genes, and H-NS appears to regulate the inserted genes |CITS: [31960057]|. H-NS binds to intergenic regions as well as regions within genes, but not all genes that bind H-NS are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to HN-S in maintenance of nucleoid structure.There is a higher diversity in the sequence of HNS-bound intergenic regions than in HNS-unbound intergenic regions, and that diversity sometimes alters gene expression |CITS:[26789284]|. The HNS-bound regions have been conserved through evolution in the <i>E. coli</i> lineage|CITS:[26789284]|. Currently, there are different models for the formation of DNA-H-NS-DNA bridges which show that this protein binds in tandem to sequences in the genome, forming multimers |CITS: [15853876][17191074][16879983]|. H-NS both changes DNA rigidity and forms bridges between DNA molecules in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> |CITS:[29127381]|.  The intrinsic curvature and flexibility of binding sites of H-NS were investigated. The preference of H-NS for high intrinsic curvature is not as clear as with other DNA-binding proteins. The binding sites for H-NS show no preference to specific curvature level, and the binding affinity for H-NS does not seem to depend on the level of intrinsic curvature |CITS:[29625128]|.  The binding of H-NS along the DNA negatively correlates with transcriptional propensity and positively correlates with integration of foreign DNA and high AT content |CITS: [30904377]|. The main effect of H-NS on low transcription appears to be on the chromosomal integration region instead of an effect on specific promoters to which it binds |CITS: [30904377]|.  Based on studies of single-molecule tracking, it was determined that on average, at any time 73% of H-NS molecules are in long-lived DNA-bound complexes at target sites, 27% are transiently, nonspecifically DNA-bound, and only 0.1% are in free diffusion between DNA strands; a diffusion coefficient of 0.41 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>  was calculated |CITS: [33621478]|.   As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, the expression of <i>hns</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, <i>hns</i> is autoregulated, and it is controlled by different transcription factors. <i>hns</i> is induced by high hydrostatic pressure |CITS: [8226663]| and DNA synthesis |CITS: [8596450]|. At the posttranscriptional level, it is subject to regulation by the sRNAs Hfq and DsrA |CITS: [11115103][12554874][15814430][15147838][12753181]|.  It is a DNA-binding protein with similarity to StpA |CITS: [7961433][1480493]| and these two proteins can have similar functions |CITS: [10515926][10947847]|. It has an approximately fivefold-lower affinity for DNA than StpA and has a major preference for curved DNA |CITS: [11278075]|.  StpA appears to be a backup for Hns in the regulation of a set of nonessential and recently acquired genes |CITS: [23661089]|.  Expression of <i>stpA</i> from a plasmid can complement an <i>hns</i> mutant phenotype and StpA is able to repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes, but the specific mechanisms remain to be determined |CITS: [7961433][11278075][8890170][8635467][19151137][8890170]|. H-NS has two dimerization domains (N-terminal and central) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The H-NS polypeptide can assemble as long polymeric filaments on DNA, and mutations in any of the three domains confer a dominant-negative phenotype <i>in vivo</i> by a subunit-poisoning mechanism |CITS:[30724731]|. A dominant negative form of StpA can disrupt H-NS activity and vice versa, and H-NS can interact with StpA at two distinct domains to form heterodimers in vitro; also, there is evidence that these proteins can form homodimers |CITS: [11244076][8755860][10203842][8755860]|. For this reason, in the absence of H-NS the StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner |CITS: [11244076][10485902]|; protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by a direct interaction between StpA and H-NS |CITS: [11244076]|. On the other hand H-NS also may form heterotrimeric complexes with Hha and YdgT |CITS: [17116239][15458420]|. It was proposed that Hha enhances the oligomerization of Hns/StpA which is necessary to form DNA-protein filaments to repress transcription |CITS: [23543115][23601147]|. The high-resolution structure based on solid-state NMR spectra from full-length H-NS has been determined |CITS: [23601147]|. H-NS variants L26PHis, I119THis, and D93His are dominant-negative <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[30724731]|. Another dominant-negative truncation mutant, D64 (which possesses only the proteins N-terminal domain)per se, completely and unexpectedly inhibited transcription in assay formats (initiation plus elongation, or elongation alone) |CITS:[30724731]|. It is proposed that under certain growth conditions, RNA polymerase is the direct inhibitory target of Hha, whose effect is mimicked by the isolated N-terminal domain of H-NS |CITS:[30724731]|. StpA and Hha stimulate pausing by RNA polymerase at 20<sup>o</sup>C by promoting DNA-DNA bridging of H-NS filaments, through H-NS-mediated gene regulation |CITS:[29718386]|. Growth phase-dependent relocalization is shown by H-NS in response to hyperosmotic shock. A novel observation of a dynamic compaction of the bacterial chromosome in response to exposure to high levels of salt was reported |CITS:[31481544]|.  It has been demonstrated that cAMP, GDP, GTP, and ppGGpp bind to H-NS, suggesting a modulatory effect of these nucleotides on the protein; nevertheless, no effect on gene expression in vitro was observed when ppGpp was bound to H-NS |CITS: [34360641]|.  H-NS is a small protein and it is an abundant nucleic acid protein in the genome, with about 20,000 copies per cell. This regulator belongs to the histone-like family of transcriptional regulators, and the structure of the protein consists of two structured domains which are separated by a flexible linker |CITS: [15100692]|.  The linker region connecting the N-terminal oligomerization and C-terminal DNA-binding domains  promotes H-NS/DNA binding and thus plays an important role in H-NS gene silencing. H-NS does not play a major role in chromosomal compaction |CITS:[29109287]|. The N-terminal domain is required for oligomerization and it  is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the purified C-terminal domain is involved in DNA binding |CITS: [15100692][10203842][8755860][15063845][19740756]|. The cooperative binding of H-NS to DNA is related to protein-protein interactions |CITS: [24275506]|. The N-terminal domain is composed of two dimerization sites, dimerization site-1 and site-2, which are both required for H-NS oligomerization. The dimerization site-2 of H-NS is required for gene silencing and nucleoprotein filament formation |CITS:[29695505]|.  The concentration of H-NS is an important influence on the formation of H-NS-DNA assemblies. H-NS oligomerization is not sufficient in forming large structures of H-NS-DNA assemblies, indicating oligomerization along bacterial DNA is crucial  |CITS:[31491518]|.  There is compelling evidence against a parallel-to-antiparallel switch mechanism at site-1 and evidence of an autoinhibitory mechanism for heat-induced unfolding of site-2, which in turn allows interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of H-NS. Temperature provokes unfolding of the central dimerization domain, breaking up H-NS multimers. This unfolding event enables an autoinhibitory compact H-NS conformation that blocks DNA binding |CITS:[30597093]|.  H-NS forms two compact clusters associated with each copy of the chromosome. These clusters are located near the one-quarter and three-quarter positions along the long axis of the cell |CITS: [21903814]|. In cells with three clusters, the additional cluster tends to appear in the middle |CITS: [21903814]|. The two cluster formations are induced by the N-terminal domain-driven oligomerization of the protein |CITS: [21903814]|. H-NS sequesters the regulated genes and operons into these clusters and juxtaposed numerous DNA segments broadly distributed throughout the chromosome |CITS: [21903814]|. Wang et al. (2011) reported that H-NS clusters could thus serve as anchoring points for numerous DNA loci distributed throughout the genome, creating DNA loops connecting the anchored loci |CITS: [21903814]|.   Cellular treatment with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) or Ag<sup>+</sup> ions causes the formation of denser and larger clusters of H-NS at the center of the cell |CITS: [31212266]|. Ag<sup>+</sup> ions led to faster diffusive dynamics of H-NS proteins |CITS:[31953329]|. Based on an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) on purified H-NS protein and isothermal titration calorimetry, it was confirmed that Ag<sup>+</sup> ions weaken the binding between H-NS proteins and DNA and that DNA and Ag<sup>+</sup> ions  interact directly |CITS:[31953329]|.  It was found that the promoter islands, which are regions of DNA containing multiple transcription start sites, are recognized and inactivated by HNS. These promoter islands are associated with genes acquired horizontally |CITS: [23717391]|.  Based on ChIP-chip and chip-seq analysis, it was proved that Rho-dependent termination abrogates the H-NS-DNA interactions, leading to transcriptional derepression of H-NS-silenced genes |CITS: [24499790]|.  An <i>hns</i>-<i>stpA</i> double mutant displayed slow growth and resulted in high expression of otherwise-silent horizontally acquired genes |CITS: [25429971]|. H-NS engineered mutants showed enhanced acid tolerance |CITS:[30053876]|.  Several mutations in the &sigma;<sup>38</sup> (RpoS) factor, as well as a duplication of ~40% of the genome centered around the origin of replication, converge in partially redressing the transcriptional imbalance of a strain lacking the H-NS/StpA gene-silencing system. This findings suggests a possible role for &sigma;<sup>38</sup> in transcription of many H-NS targets |CITS: [25429971]|.  Transcription from a neighboring region extends into an H-NS-bound locus and it can disrupt local H-NS repression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating a novel mechanism by which H-NS-mediated silencing can be reversed |CITS: [29424946]|.   Rangarajan and Schnetz showed that when transcription from a neighboring region extends into an H-NS-bound locus, it can disrupt local H-NS repression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating a novel mechanism by which H-NS-mediated silencing can be reversed |CITS: [29473964]|.  Based on proteomic studies, it was determined that the activities of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) such as  H-NS, HU, IHF, and FIS are also modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that signal differences in growth conditions; because none of the NAPs are known to bind any signaling ligands, these growth condition signals may be compensated for by these PTMs |CITS: [30287510]|.  The negative supercoiling of DNA in Fis, H-NS, and HU transcription factors modulates their 3D shape and determines their molecular dynamics |CITS: [28191853]|. The circular supercoiled DNA dynamically folds in particular higher-order structures (hyperplectonemes) |CITS: [28191853]|.  The architecture and structural and functional characteristics of analogs of H-NS found in other bacterial species that are able to bridge DNA duplexes (a key to genome compaction), gene regulation, and their response to changing conditions in the environment were reviewed |CITS: [31795918]|.   Based on the Magnetic Tweezers technique, a cooperative effect was observed between H-NS activity and the depletion of forces induced by the crowding agent PEG|CITS:[32891648]|.  Missense or insertion mutations in the <i>hns</i> gene compensate for a knockout mutation in the genes encoding the major antibiotic efflux pumps AcrAB and AcrEF through derepression of genes enconding the MdtEF efflux pump |CITS: [33972351]|.

It is a global transcriptional silencer of genes with high AT content |CITS: [15100692][18387844]|, regulates 5% of all <i>Escherichia coli</i> genes |CITS: [11298273]|, and plays a key role in global chromosome organization in bacteria |CITS: [21903814]|. This protein acts as a pleiotropic transcriptional factor with a strong preference for horizontally acquired genes among the 250 loci to which it binds |CITS: [2126011][17046956][31960057]|. H-NS functions almost exclusively as a transcriptional repressor, although there is no clear evidence that this regulator is an activator. Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature, although Reush et al. proposed that this regulator can form a complex with a short chain of polyhydroxybutyrate |CITS: [12220682]|. Additional genes might be identified by high-throughput analysis |CITS: [19151137]|.

H-NS suppresses transcription initiation at many intragenic sites as well as transcription of non-coding RNAs genome-wide |CITS: [24449106]|, such as antisense RNAs located in regions enriched with RNA polymerase-binding RNA aptamers (RAPs) |CITS: [31535128]|.


H-NS plays an important role in the regulation of many genes in response to environmental changes and adaptation to stress; therefore, it is  capable of controlling its own synthesis |CITS: [7934818][8830277]|. It also regulates transcription of many other genes that participate in a variety of cellular functions, including genes involved in the following processes or responses: biogenesis of flagella |CITS: [8071234][10601207][11872702]|, transcription control of the type I fimbria structural genes |CITS: [9922259][9352908][9595659][7510658][9749677]|, acid resistance  |CITS: [16204188]|, the functional glutamic acid-dependent system |CITS: [10383761]|, osmotically inducible genes |CITS: [9663683]|, the glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance system |CITS: [15795232][12446650][11976288][11298273]|, osmotic control |CITS: [8120010][11673423]|, the type II secretion pathway |CITS: [11118204]|, carbon sources |CITS: [2160266]|, genes involved in the RNA component of the small subunit (30S subunit) |CITS: [9632265][15686546]|, and proteases |CITS: [16143461]|, among others. It has also been shown to be involved in survival during stationary phase, conferring to the bacteria a growth advantage during stationary phase (GASP) |CITS: [22843842]|. A lack of H-NS results in overexpression of <i>ycdT</i>, <i>ydeH</i>, <i>yeal</i>, <i>yeaJ</i>, <i>yaiC</i>, <i>csgD</i>, <i>iraP</i>, and <i>ydiV</i>, while expression of <i>fliA</i> is decreased. These results indicate that H-NS influences motility via multiple regulatory linkages that include, minimally, the messenger molecule cyclic di-GMP, the biofilm regulatory protein CsgD, and the sigma factors &sigma;<sup>S</sup> and &sigma;<sup>F</sup>, thus impacting motility through diverse regulatory pathways |CITS: [26195595]|.

H-NS is capable of inducing severe bends in the DNA, interacting with a large number of DNA regions that contain a planar curvature |CITS: [2126011][1745240][14627810]|. It has been suggested that H-NS binds strongly to sites carrying a 10-bp AT-rich consensus sequence, which functions as a nucleation site for the formation of a repressive higher-order nucleoprotein complex |CITS: [17881364][19740756]|. That AT-rich sequence for H-NS DNA binding is preferred for insertion of horizontally acquired genes, and H-NS appears to regulate the inserted genes |CITS: [31960057]|. H-NS binds to intergenic regions as well as regions within genes, but not all genes that bind H-NS are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to HN-S in maintenance of nucleoid structure.There is a higher diversity in the sequence of HNS-bound intergenic regions than in HNS-unbound intergenic regions, and that diversity sometimes alters gene expression |CITS:[26789284]|. The HNS-bound regions have been conserved through evolution in the <i>E. coli</i> lineage|CITS:[26789284]|. Currently, there are different models for the formation of DNA-H-NS-DNA bridges which show that this protein binds in tandem to sequences in the genome, forming multimers |CITS: [15853876][17191074][16879983]|. H-NS both changes DNA rigidity and forms bridges between DNA molecules in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> |CITS:[29127381]|.

The intrinsic curvature and flexibility of binding sites of H-NS were investigated. The preference of H-NS for high intrinsic curvature is not as clear as with other DNA-binding proteins. The binding sites for H-NS show no preference to specific curvature level, and the binding affinity for H-NS does not seem to depend on the level of intrinsic curvature |CITS:[29625128]|.

The binding of H-NS along the DNA negatively correlates with transcriptional propensity and positively correlates with integration of foreign DNA and high AT content |CITS: [30904377]|. The main effect of H-NS on low transcription appears to be on the chromosomal integration region instead of an effect on specific promoters to which it binds |CITS: [30904377]|.

Based on studies of single-molecule tracking, it was determined that on average, at any time 73% of H-NS molecules are in long-lived DNA-bound complexes at target sites, 27% are transiently, nonspecifically DNA-bound, and only 0.1% are in free diffusion between DNA strands; a diffusion coefficient of 0.41 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>  was calculated |CITS: [33621478]|. 

As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, the expression of <i>hns</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, <i>hns</i> is autoregulated, and it is controlled by different transcription factors. <i>hns</i> is induced by high hydrostatic pressure |CITS: [8226663]| and DNA synthesis |CITS: [8596450]|. At the posttranscriptional level, it is subject to regulation by the sRNAs Hfq and DsrA |CITS: [11115103][12554874][15814430][15147838][12753181]|.

It is a DNA-binding protein with similarity to StpA |CITS: [7961433][1480493]| and these two proteins can have similar functions |CITS: [10515926][10947847]|. It has an approximately fivefold-lower affinity for DNA than StpA and has a major preference for curved DNA |CITS: [11278075]|.  StpA appears to be a backup for Hns in the regulation of a set of nonessential and recently acquired genes |CITS: [23661089]|.

Expression of <i>stpA</i> from a plasmid can complement an <i>hns</i> mutant phenotype and StpA is able to repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes, but the specific mechanisms remain to be determined |CITS: [7961433][11278075][8890170][8635467][19151137][8890170]|. H-NS has two dimerization domains (N-terminal and central) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The H-NS polypeptide can assemble as long polymeric filaments on DNA, and mutations in any of the three domains confer a dominant-negative phenotype <i>in vivo</i> by a subunit-poisoning mechanism |CITS:[30724731]|. A dominant negative form of StpA can disrupt H-NS activity and vice versa, and H-NS can interact with StpA at two distinct domains to form heterodimers in vitro; also, there is evidence that these proteins can form homodimers |CITS: [11244076][8755860][10203842][8755860]|. For this reason, in the absence of H-NS the StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner |CITS: [11244076][10485902]|; protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by a direct interaction between StpA and H-NS |CITS: [11244076]|. On the other hand H-NS also may form heterotrimeric complexes with Hha and YdgT |CITS: [17116239][15458420]|. It was proposed that Hha enhances the oligomerization of Hns/StpA which is necessary to form DNA-protein filaments to repress transcription |CITS: [23543115][23601147]|. The high-resolution structure based on solid-state NMR spectra from full-length H-NS has been determined |CITS: [23601147]|. H-NS variants L26PHis, I119THis, and D93His are dominant-negative <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[30724731]|. Another dominant-negative truncation mutant, D64 (which possesses only the proteins N-terminal domain)per se, completely and unexpectedly inhibited transcription in assay formats (initiation plus elongation, or elongation alone) |CITS:[30724731]|. It is proposed that under certain growth conditions, RNA polymerase is the direct inhibitory target of Hha, whose effect is mimicked by the isolated N-terminal domain of H-NS |CITS:[30724731]|. StpA and Hha stimulate pausing by RNA polymerase at 20<sup>o</sup>C by promoting DNA-DNA bridging of H-NS filaments, through H-NS-mediated gene regulation |CITS:[29718386]|. Growth phase-dependent relocalization is shown by H-NS in response to hyperosmotic shock. A novel observation of a dynamic compaction of the bacterial chromosome in response to exposure to high levels of salt was reported |CITS:[31481544]|.

It has been demonstrated that cAMP, GDP, GTP, and ppGGpp bind to H-NS, suggesting a modulatory effect of these nucleotides on the protein; nevertheless, no effect on gene expression in vitro was observed when ppGpp was bound to H-NS |CITS: [34360641]|.

This regulator belongs to the histone-like family of transcriptional regulators, and the structure of the protein consists of two structured domains which are separated by a flexible linker |CITS: [15100692]|.  The linker region connecting the N-terminal oligomerization and C-terminal DNA-binding domains  promotes H-NS/DNA binding and thus plays an important role in H-NS gene silencing. H-NS does not play a major role in chromosomal compaction |CITS:[29109287]|. The N-terminal domain is required for oligomerization and it  is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the purified C-terminal domain is involved in DNA binding |CITS: [15100692][10203842][8755860][15063845][19740756]|. The cooperative binding of H-NS to DNA is related to protein-protein interactions |CITS: [24275506]|. The N-terminal domain is composed of two dimerization sites, dimerization site-1 and site-2, which are both required for H-NS oligomerization. The dimerization site-2 of H-NS is required for gene silencing and nucleoprotein filament formation |CITS:[29695505]|.

The concentration of H-NS is an important influence on the formation of H-NS-DNA assemblies. H-NS oligomerization is not sufficient in forming large structures of H-NS-DNA assemblies, indicating oligomerization along bacterial DNA is crucial  |CITS:[31491518]|.

There is compelling evidence against a parallel-to-antiparallel switch mechanism at site-1 and evidence of an autoinhibitory mechanism for heat-induced unfolding of site-2, which in turn allows interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of H-NS. Temperature provokes unfolding of the central dimerization domain, breaking up H-NS multimers. This unfolding event enables an autoinhibitory compact H-NS conformation that blocks DNA binding |CITS:[30597093]|.

H-NS forms two compact clusters associated with each copy of the chromosome. These clusters are located near the one-quarter and three-quarter positions along the long axis of the cell |CITS: [21903814]|. In cells with three clusters, the additional cluster tends to appear in the middle |CITS: [21903814]|.

Cellular treatment with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) or Ag<sup>+</sup> ions causes the formation of denser and larger clusters of H-NS at the center of the cell |CITS: [31212266]|. Ag<sup>+</sup> ions led to faster diffusive dynamics of H-NS proteins |CITS:[31953329]|. Based on an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) on purified H-NS protein and isothermal titration calorimetry, it was confirmed that Ag<sup>+</sup> ions weaken the binding between H-NS proteins and DNA and that DNA and Ag<sup>+</sup> ions  interact directly |CITS:[31953329]|.

It was found that the promoter islands, which are regions of DNA containing multiple transcription start sites, are recognized and inactivated by HNS. These promoter islands are associated with genes acquired horizontally |CITS: [23717391]|.

Based on ChIP-chip and chip-seq analysis, it was proved that Rho-dependent termination abrogates the H-NS-DNA interactions, leading to transcriptional derepression of H-NS-silenced genes |CITS: [24499790]|.

An <i>hns</i>-<i>stpA</i> double mutant displayed slow growth and resulted in high expression of otherwise-silent horizontally acquired genes |CITS: [25429971]|. H-NS engineered mutants showed enhanced acid tolerance |CITS:[30053876]|.

Several mutations in the &sigma;<sup>38</sup> (RpoS) factor, as well as a duplication of ~40% of the genome centered around the origin of replication, converge in partially redressing the transcriptional imbalance of a strain lacking the H-NS/StpA gene-silencing system. This findings suggests a possible role for &sigma;<sup>38</sup> in transcription of many H-NS targets |CITS: [25429971]|.

Transcription from a neighboring region extends into an H-NS-bound locus and it can disrupt local H-NS repression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating a novel mechanism by which H-NS-mediated silencing can be reversed |CITS: [29424946]|.

The negative supercoiling of DNA in Fis, H-NS, and HU transcription factors modulates their 3D shape and determines their molecular dynamics |CITS: [28191853]|. The circular supercoiled DNA dynamically folds in particular higher-order structures (hyperplectonemes) |CITS: [28191853]|.

The architecture and structural and functional characteristics of analogs of H-NS found in other bacterial species that are able to bridge DNA duplexes (a key to genome compaction), gene regulation, and their response to changing conditions in the environment were reviewed |CITS: [31795918]|.

ECK120011298	SoxS	20	asymmetric	AraC/XylS		ECK12	SoxS is a dual transcriptional activator and participates in the removal of superoxide and nitric oxide and protection from organic solvents and antibiotics |CITS: [8955629][16336183][19376854][1400156][1653416][8034583][9324261]|.  SoxS shares 49% identity with MarA and the N-terminal domain of Rob |CITS: [8383113]|. These proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes |CITS: [10852879][12067348][14712652][11395452]|, the <i>marA/soxS/rob</i> regulon, involved in antibiotic resistance |CITS: [8636021][15853893][7896685]|, superoxide resistance |CITS: [8626315][1400156][1317841]|, and tolerance to organic solvents |CITS: [9324261][9783171]| and heavy metals |CITS: [7793951]|. The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS: [11844771][12791142]|, and the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate |CITS: [11395452][27098660]| and by oxidative stress |CITS: [8955629]|, respectively. SoxS was induced by tellurite (TeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) in a DNA microarray analysis |CITS: [25049169]|.   Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS: [14594836]|.  SoxS, MarA, and Rob bind as monomers to the same DNA site, a degenerate 20-bp sequence known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|. In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the -35 box and are generally oriented in the backward direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|. As a subset of the class I promoters, the Mar-Sox-Rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|.  The Mar-Sox-Rob box contains an "invariant A" at position 1, two recognition elements, the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS: [10802742][11724537][11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS: [11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS: [11985714]|. It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named "DNA scanning" or "prerecruitment." In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites |CITS: [11985714][11866462]|. It has been shown that SoxS binds to the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of RNA polymerase (&alpha;-CTD), in particular, it interacts with amino acid residues lying in or near the DNA-binding determinant of &alpha;-CTD.

Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites <a title="14594836" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pomposiello PJ,2003</a>.

SoxS, MarA, and Rob bind as monomers to the same DNA site, a degenerate 20-bp sequence known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter <a title="10564485, 10564484" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG,1999. Wood TI,1999</a>.

ECK120011302	OxyR	17	inverted-repeat	LysR		ECK12	OxyR, "oxidative stress regulator," is the transcriptional dual regulator for the expression of antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress, in particular, elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide. The OxyR regulon includes genes involved in peroxide metabolism, redox balance, and peroxide protection by, for example, manganese uptake |CITS: [2256675][11443091][12100544][19400769]|. Moreover, OxyR activates the synthesis of the small, noncoding <i>oxyS</i> RNA. This allows OxyR to regulate as many as 40 additional gene products indirectly by affecting mRNA stability or translation efficiency |CITS: [9230301]|. OxyR acts as a repressor for its own synthesis in both the oxidized and reduced forms |CITS: [2471187][1864839]|.  Accordingly, point mutations observed in <i>oxyR</i> as a result of adaptive evolution under high iron conditions lead to increased expression levels of OxyR-regulated genes, also termed the OxyR i-modulon |CITS: [31651953]|. For more information on i-modulons, see |CITS: [31797920]|. In addition, expression of <i>oxyR</i> is positively regulated by cAMP-activated Crp protein during exponential growth and negatively regulated by RpoS when cells enter stationary phase |CITS: [9324269]|. Based on microarray assays, a new function as regulator of S-nitrosylation (a nitrosative stress regulon) under anaerobic conditions has been determined for OxyR |CITS: [22539721]|, and it is distinct from the OxyR regulon activated by oxidative stress |CITS: [22539721]|.  OxyR consists of 305 amino acid residues and is a member of the LysR family of bacterial transcription factors |CITS: [2471187][2511419]|. It is a tetramer in solution |CITS: [7868603]|. OxyR consists of two domains, the N-terminal domain, carrying a helix-turn-helix motif, and the C-terminal regulatory domain. A flexible linker connects both domains. The C-terminal domain contains the determinants for oligomerization and two redox-active cysteines, Cys199 and Cys208 |CITS: [7868603][15543158][12595552]|. OxyR functions as a reversible cellular redox switch. In the presence of 100 nM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, activation occurs by the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys208 |CITS: [2183352][15543158]|. It was determined that concentrations of >2 &mu;M extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> trigger the intracellular OxyR stress response, and >5 &mu;M begins to impair cell growth in minimal medium |CITS: [29550333]|. Consistent with this, in minimal medium dose-dependent growth retardation occurred in the wild type and in a Glucose Minimal Media Optimized Strain (GMOS), but no significant impact of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the growth profile of iron-evolved strains was noted, as overexpression of OxyR-regulated ROS-detoxifying genes rendered the strains tolerant to peroxide |CITS: [31651953]|. In contrast with activation, inactivation of OxyR involves reduction of the disulfide bond by glutaredoxin 1 and glutathione |CITS: [9497290]|. Oxidation is significantly faster than reduction, allowing for transient activation in a reducing environment |CITS: [10339558]|. OxyR is also activated under nitrosative stress; this reaction involves S-nitrosylation of OxyR on Cys25 in planktonic cells under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions |CITS: [8797819][33850153]|. A mutant in Cys25 causes an increment of biofilm formation |CITS: [33850153]|.  The crystal structures of the regulatory domain of OxyR in both its reduced and oxidized forms have been solved. Comparison of both structures reveals that oxidation is accompanied by a significant structural change in the regulatory domain |CITS: [11301006]|. OxyR also senses sulfane sulfur (H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub>), which is toxic under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions at high levels. OxyR is required to deal with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only under aerobic conditions, whereas it responds to H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub> under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions |CITS: [31421411]|. Sulfane sulfur modifies OxyR at Cys<sup>199</sup> to form a protein persulfide that in turn activates the expression of thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and catalase. The Cys residues C199 and C208 are required for such induction, and OxyR Cys<sup>199</sup> persulfidation is likely the mechanism of sensing H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub> |CITS: [31421411]|.  Under ampicillin treatment, the activity of OxyR appears to be affected |CITS: [33731833]|.  In systematic studies of oligomerization, it was shown that some members of the LysR family, like OxyR, interact with other members of the family to form heterodimers, but the physiological significance of this is unknown |CITS: [21187915]|. OxyR can bind as a pair of dimers bending to the DNA |CITS: [12706716][22692422]|.   OxyR recognizes a motif comprised of ATAGnt elements spaced at 10-bp intervals |CITS: [8087856]|. The binding to DNA differs significantly for the oxidized and reduced forms |CITS: [8087856]|. Reduced OxyR binds DNA at two pairs of major grooves separated by one helical turn, while oxidized OxyR occupies four consecutive major grooves. When bound to DNA, oxidized OxyR stimulates transcription by interacting with the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of RNA polymerase |CITS: [7592462]|. OxyR homologs are widely present in bacteria; 4772 homologs of OxyR were identified and distributed in 4494 bacterial genomes |CITS: [31421411]|.  A review of the function of OxyR in protecting against nitrosative stress under anaerobic conditions revealed parallels between regulation of S-nitrosylation and hypoxic signaling by nitric oxide (NO) in mammalian cells, and in mitochondria in particular |CITS: [31691575]|.

ECK120011306	PhoB	19	direct-repeat	OmpR		ECK12	PhoB is a dual transcription regulator that activates expression of the Pho regulon in response to environmental P<sub>i</sub>. The Pho regulon includes operons and genes whose products are involved in phosphorus uptake and metabolism |CITS:[8432742][8755861][17020555]|. Expression of the periplasmic binding proteins for peptide transport, OppA and DppA, is repressed by PhoB |CITS:[1478454]|. In a proteomic analysis under phosphate-limiting conditions, it was found that up to 400 proteins are differentially expressed |CITS:[8755861]|. PhoB is also involved in bacterial virulence of pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[21700403]|. PhoB also regulates genes involved in the stimulation of cell persister resuscitation |CITS:[34668292]|.  PhoB is a response regulator and belongs to the two-component system PhoR/PhoB. Under phosphate-limited conditions, the inner membrane sensor kinase PhoR autophosphorylates. Subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to PhoB results in activation of PhoB |CITS:[2693738]|. When phosphate is in excess, autophosphorylation of PhoR is inhibited and PhoB-P is dephosphorylated. Autoregulation of PhoB/PhoR expression serves as a mechanism for cells to achieve respective optimal densities and fitness under these conditions |CITS:[24204322]|. This negative regulation requires in addition to PhoR an intact Pst system and PhoU |CITS:[8691745]|. In the absence of PhoR, cross-regulation of PhoB by CreC or acetyl phosphate results in phosphorylation of PhoB in response to carbon sources |CITS:[1551836][2228961]|. A heterodimer formed between a phosphorylated monomer and an unphosphorylated monomer of PhoB plays an important role in PhoB autophosphorylation kinetics |CITS:[23760278]|.   PhoB consists of two functional domains, the N-terminal receiver domain, which is phosphorylated, and the C-terminal output domain, which binds to DNA and interacts with the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription |CITS:[8648643][8422984]|. The output domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors |CITS:[9199401]|. Its activity is silenced by the receiver domain, and phosphorylation relieves inhibition |CITS:[11073900]|. The 3D structure of the receiver domain |CITS:[9878437]| and of two constitutively active mutants of this domain |CITS:[17182055]| and the 3D structure of the output domain have been solved |CITS:[9016718]|. By using motif binding geometries (MBG), a structural model of the PhoB dimer in the transcription initiation complex PhoB/RNAP/&sigma; factor/DNA has been developed |CITS:[22433509]|.  PhoB binds to the Pho box, the structure of a PhoB-DNA complex, revealing that sequence changes within the 4-bp region can alter the binding affinity without changing the major groove-contacting TGTCA tract that is important for binding specificity. Sequences are less conserved within this 4-bp region than in the rest of the 18-bp region |CITS: [26015501]|.  The 18-bp region has been described as two direct 11-bp repeats consisting of successive 7-bp direct repeats followed by an A/T-rich region of 4 bp, situated 10 bp upstream of the -10 region |CITS:[3054125][12015152][3537313]|. The <i>pho</i> promoters contain functional -10 sequences but lack the consensus -35 sequence |CITS:[2651888]|.  The 3D structure of the PhoB effector domain in complex with its target DNA sequence reveals a novel tandem arrangement in which several monomers bind head to tail to successive 11-bp direct repeat sequences, coating one face of the double helix |CITS:[12015152][16154092]|.  Based on DNA microarray analysis, it has been shown that PhoBR and PhoB are responsible for upregulation of phosphonate and glycerol phosphate metabolism and the high-affinity phosphate transport system, respectively, thus showing the complex regulation by the PhoR-PhoB two-component regulatory system |CITS:[18051755]|. The expression timing of PhoB regulation and the temporal hierarchy are related, as the genes involved in direct P<sub>i</sub> uptake contain high-affinity sites and are transcribed earlier than genes involved in phosphorus scavenging |CITS: [26015501]|. Although PhoB is activated under P<sub>i</sub> limitation, it can also be activated under nonlimiting P<sub>i</sub> conditions |CITS:[27023099]|.  PhoB is involved in the inhibition of biofilm formation that is triggered by fluctuations  in poly(P) levels during the stationary phase |CITS:[27023099]|.  Based on results of a transcription reporter assay and <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation analysis, the shutoff response for the PhoR-PhoB system was determined |CITS: [28512092]|. These comprehensive analyses revealed the impact of phosphatase activity on shutoff kinetics. The ratio of the phosphatase rate to the nonspecific phosphorylation rate correlated with TCS expression levels and the ratio of activity of the RR (PhoB response regulator) to that of the HK (histidine kinase), which may contribute to the great diversity of enzyme levels and the activities observed in different TCSs |CITS: [28512092]|.  The memory of the PhoB-PhoR two-component system (TCS) was used to study how cells cope with the recurrence of P<sub>i</sub> starvation via a TCS. Memory prior P<sub>i</sub> starvation can exert distinct effects through two regulatory pathways, TCS signaling and the stress response |CITS:[28674072]|. The crystal structures for inactivated and BeF<sub>3</sub>-activated PhoB<sub>N</sub> (N-terminal receiver domain) were solved by using X-ray at 2.4 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively |CITS:[29299752]|. The backbone assignment of a PhoB<sub>N</sub><sup>F20D</sup> mutant has been determined using NMR spectroscopy, and this  information could be useful for studying the structure and dynamics of the PhoB receiver domain and its mechanism of phosphorylation in TCSs |CITS:[29299752]|. Based on NMR spectroscopy, the apo form of the N-terminal receiver domain (PhoB<sub>N</sub>) in solution was determined |CITS:[29722984]|. In addition, it was shown via concentration dilution experiments and backbone relaxation parameters that PhoB<sub>N</sub> exists in equilibrium between monomer and dimer states. Finally,  paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements showed that the dimer of apo PhoBN forms several transient dimer interfaces in solution |CITS:[29722984]|.  Based on wild-type and recombinant cells cultivated in two different substrates (lactose  and glycerol), the effect of phosphate-starved response (PSR) stimuli was investigated. Gene expression analysis showed that under PSR conditions, selected genes (<i>gapA, pykF, ppsA, icdA</i>) in the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (<i>zwf, gnd, talB, tktA</i>) were up-regulated, whereas other genes in lactose (<i>lacY, lacA</i>) and acetate (<i>ackA, pta</i>) metabolism pathways were down-regulated. It was also demonstrated that Cra, CRP transcription factors, and the PhoBR two-component signal transduction system are involved in the regulation of central carbon metabolism |CITS:[33001250]|.

The homodimers of RcsB activate transcription, interacting with the RNA polymerase, by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoter; the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5 |CITS: [16153174][11566985][15901715][15838058][10564486][12410838]|. The formation of heterodimers between RcsB and the RcsA auxiliary protein stabilizes interactions with the distant binding sites |CITS: [10702265][8763957][16153174][17468243][12864862][17379715]|.  The amount of RcsA protein is limited both by its rapid degradation by two proteases, Lon and ClpYQ, and by its low level of synthesis |CITS: [16153174][7534408][3888955][3029041][1999391][8759878][1943696][14766922][12670962]|.   RcsB, which belongs to the two-component family, shows a helix-turn-helix motif for interaction with DNA in the C-terminal domain, while the the N-terminal domain is typical of the response regulator |CITS: [16153174]|.  Regulator protein RcsB is a member of the two-component regulatory system RcsC/RcsB |CITS [7855424][8366025][2836365]|. It is involved in the activation of colanic acid capsule synthesis (<i>cps</i>) and cell division (<i>ftsZ</i>) genes |CITS: [10702265][7855424][8576059][2836365][10564486]|. The activation of colanic acid production is through the RcsCDB phosphorelay system in response to structural changes in lipopolysaccharide |CITS:[27002133]|. Based on its homology to other regulator proteins in <i>E. coli</i>, it is believed that the RcsB protein is activated through phosphorylation, probably by the sensor protein RcsC |CITS: [9209051]|. However, direct phosphorylation of RcsB by RcsC has not been shown. Z nucleotides [ZMP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-monophosphate) and/or ZTP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-triphosphate)] can act as direct phosphodonors to RcsB <i>in vivo</i>, activating it in an RcsC-independent manner |CITS: [33318202]|. The RcsF protein may also be capable of phosphorylating RcsB. Once activated, the RcsB protein is a positive regulator of capsule synthesis and cell division |CITS: [10702265][7855424][8576059][2836365][10564486]|. Regulator protein RcsB complexes with the RcsA protein (forming a heterodimer) for capsule synthesis activation |CITS: [10702265][1943696][7855424]|. RcsB activates the <i>fts</i> genes independently (in the form of a homodimer) |CITS: [1597415]|. RscB forms a heterodimer with MatA, activating transcription of the <i>mat</i>operon (using the<i>matA</i>promoter and regulatory region of uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> strain CFT073) in a phosphorylation-independent way. However, this has not been demonstrated for <i>E. coli</i> K-12. This heterodimer probably represses motility in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 (T1241 motile strain) |CITS: [26635367]|.  Several residues in the RcsB receptor domain are crucial for forming complexes with other proteins. The phosphorylation is necessary for the stabilization of the active form of RcsB-RcsB and RcsA-RcsB complexes, while BglJ-RcsB and MatA-RcsB complexes are active intrinsically |CITS: [26635367]|.  The crystal structures of unphosphorylated RcsB in complex with the consensus DNA-binding sequence of a 22-mer (DNA22) and an 18-mer (DNA18) of the <i>flhDC</i> operon have been solved  at 3.15 and 3.37 &Aring; resolution, respectively |CITS: [29487239]|. It was demostrated that RcsB recognizes target DNA sequences, and the same study revealed a unique oligomeric state that allows RcsB to form homo- and heterodimers |CITS: [29487239]|.  RcsB is a member of the LuxR/UhpA protein family.  Overproduction causes a drug resistance phenotype and affects transcription of genes involved in drug efflux |CITS: [12618449]|.

RcsC is a sensor histidine kinase and is known to be a transmembrane protein composed of three domains: the external sensory domain (amino terminal), a cytoplasmic transmitter domain (carboxyl terminal), and a transmembrane hydrophobic central domain (unknown function).

ECK120011345	ArcA	15		OmpR		ECK12	ArcA is a dual transcriptional regulator for <b>A</b>noxic <b>r</b>edox <b>c</b>ontrol |CITS: [2964639][8412675][7855430]|. It acts primarily as a negative transcriptional regulator under anaerobic conditions. ArcA represses operons involved in respiratory metabolism, including those that encode products such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt, and enzymes of the pathway for fatty acid degradation |CITS: [2070418][7855430][1812811]|. In addition, ArcA acts as a repressor for <i>rpoS</i> transcription |CITS: [16291649]|. ArcA also activates a few operons encoding proteins involved in fermentative metabolism |CITS: [8071220][8892825]|. It has been identified as global repressor of carbon oxidation pathways |CITS: [24146625]|. Microarray analyses have identified a large number of genes affected by ArcA and have revealed that the Arc system and the FNR regulatory network overlap to a much greater extent than previously estimated |CITS: [15699038][14711822][15838044][33785570]|. It has been suggested that the most significant role of ArcA is under microaerobic conditions, while that of FNR is under more strictly anaerobic conditions |CITS: [12486057][15669087]|. For full expression of <i>arcA</i> both FNR and ArcA are required |CITS: [8022271]|. Distinct functional roles for both regulators have been proposed, and it has been shown that there is little direct coregulation of the two |CITS: [24146625]|.  ArcA is a response regulator and is activated as a DNA-binding protein by phosphorylation |CITS: [11527965]|. The cognate sensor kinase ArcB is membrane associated and has three cytoplasmic domains; a transmitter, a receiver, and a phosphotransfer (HPt) domain |CITS: [7957084][1597416]|. Under anaerobic conditions ArcA is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from the autophosphorylated transmitter domain of ArcB to the receiver and Hpt domain of ArcB and finally to the receiver domain of ArcA |CITS: [10851007][8825099][9286997]|. Autophosphorylation of ArcB is stimulated by effectors such as d-lactate, pyruvate, and acetate |CITS: [10585483][10585483]|. Under aerobic conditions, the autokinase activity of ArcB is inhibited by quinone electron carriers |CITS: [11423658][15326287]|, and unphosphorylated ArcB promotes the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P by a reverse phosphorelay reaction |CITS: [9830034][15838055]|. It has been suggested that ArcA may also be subject to cross-regulation by other, unknown sensor kinases |CITS: [16291649][12366850][17213678]|. Z nucleotides [ZMP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-monophosphate) and/or ZTP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-triphosphate)] can act as direct phosphodonors to ArcA <i>in vivo</i>, activating it in an ArcB-independent manner |CITS: [33318202]|.  ArcA is a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators and consists of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain  |CITS: [9205844]|. The crystal structures of the receiver domain of ArcA in the presence and absence of the phosphoryl analog BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> have been solved |CITS: [15876365]|. In the crystal structures, the receiver domain forms a symmetric dimer.  ArcA appears to be S-nitrosylated on Cys173 in planktonic cells under aerobic growth conditions |CITS: [33850153]|.  Weight matrices for the DNA-binding site for ArcA-P have been obtained. The proposed binding site consists of 15 bp with a direct spaced repeat |CITS: [15728117][10216875]|. It has been suggested that multimerization, induced by phosphorylation, is a prerequisite for binding |CITS: [11527965]|. ArcA represses transcription by directly binding to the promoter or by binding to sites overlapping an activator-binding site |CITS: [16849788][15252051]|. As an activator, it  appears to act as part of a nucleoprotein complex. For activation of <i>pfl</i>, a functional interaction between the ArcA and Fnr protein has been suggested |CITS: [1592804]|. For expression of <i>cydAB</i>, it has been shown that ArcA-P antagonizes H-NS |CITS: [11123679]|. At the R1 P<sub>Y</sub> promoter, ArcA acts in conjunction with TraJ. ArcA represses and activates transcription solely by binding DNA, and it activates only indirectly when its binding interferes with the binding and repression of another transcriptional repressor |CITS: [24146625]|. The majority of ArcA-binding sites overlap the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> promoter recognition elements |CITS: [24146625]|.  ArcA is not an essential protein |CITS: [32108145]|. Under glucose-abundant conditions, the double mutant of <i>iclR arcA</i> causes an increase in biomass yield (47%) and reduction of acetate (70%) and CO<sub>2</sub> (16%) production. Under glucose-limited conditions, this double mutant exhibits an increase of biomass of only 13% |CITS: [21481254]|. On the other hand, in an <i>arcA</i> mutant, the TCA cycle flux was increased 4.4 times above that of the wild type in the presence of nitrates, and the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio increased approximately 2-fold above that of the wild-type strain |CITS: [22790675]|.  An exhaustive analysis of the ArcA response regulator was carried out, based on different experimental methodologies, High-throughputs (ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq), bioinformatic analysis, DNase I footprinting, and gene expression profiling, and the results showed that ArcA is a global repressor of carbon oxidation pathways |CITS: [24146625]|. ArcA-P directly regulates the expression of 85 operons under anaerobic growth conditions, where 74 operons are repressed and 11 are activated |CITS: [24146625]|. The proportion of phosphorylated ArcA is increased in aerobic conditions and the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) |CITS: [26907100]|. It was shown that most ArcA-binding sites contain additional direct repeat (DR) elements as well as the two required for binding an ArcA dimer, and this finding provided a  novel insight into how ArcA accomplishes global regulation of gene expression |CITS: [24146625]|. More than 50% of the sites have additional DR elements, and the majority of ArcA-binding sites contain three to five DR elements, predominantly at a CTC spacing of 11 bp |CITS: [24146625]|. The variations in the number, spacing, location, and predicted strength of DR elements within the chromosomal ArcA-binding regions suggest plasticity in the architecture of ArcA-binding sites for either repressed or activated operons |CITS: [24146625]|.  The growth |CITS:[33785570][28573283]| and the net final biomass produced in an <i>arcA</i> single-deletion mutants  growing under anaerobic fermentation conditions were affected relative to responses of the wild-type strain (<i>Escherichia coli</i> strain BW25113) grown in the same conditions |CITS: [28573283]|. <i>arcA</i> deletion increased expression of genes involved in acetate assimilation and uptake and also genes involved in the TCA cycle |CITS: [29193870][33785570]|. The mutant also caused decreased nucleotide synthesis, decreased glucose and ammonia uptake rates, and enhanced nitrogen transport and accumulation of amino acids and their precursors, as well as derepression of alternate carbon metabolic proteins |CITS: [33785570]|. The activities of some transcription factors appear to be enhanced (ArgR, NtrC, NrdR) in the arcA mutant, whereas others are diminished (PuuR) |CITS:[33785570]|. |CITS: [29748694]| et al. reported a relative increase in glucose uptake rate above that required for the observed growth rate in an arcA mutant. In addition, higher ATP synthesis and redox balance rates were reported relative to the observed growth rate and biomass yield in the mutant |CITS: [29748694]|.  Deletion of <i>arcA</i> and <i>gutM</i> under three different antibiotics, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, significantly suppressed resistance evolution, which was not caused by epistatic interactions with mutations known to confer drug resistance |CITS:[32144279]|.   ArcA promotes dehydration tolerance, both independently and through ArcZ or RpoS |CITS: [29457688]|.  The accumulation of the protein ArcA is decreased during iron-limiting conditions |CITS: [31235512]|.  ArcA is a flux sensor for the oxygen consumption rate |CITS:[32383263]|.  Under ampicillin treatment, the activity of ArcA appears to increase |CITS: [33731833]|.  A review of the regulation of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis and molybdoenzyme gene expression via molybdenum and iron by FNR, NarXL/QP, Fur, and ArcA has been published |CITS:[31517366]|.

Iuchi S,1993. Gunsalus RP,1994</a>. It acts primarily as a negative transcriptional regulator under anaerobic conditions. ArcA represses operons involved in respiratory metabolism, including those that encode products such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt, and enzymes of the pathway for fatty acid degradation <a title="2070418, 7855430, 1812811" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iuchi S, Lin EC,1991.

It has been identified as global repressor of carbon oxidation pathways <a title="24146625" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Park DM,2013</a>. Microarray analyses have identified a large number of genes affected by ArcA and have revealed that the Arc system and the FNR regulatory network overlap to a much greater extent than previously estimated <a title="15699038, 14711822, 15838044, 33785570" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Salmon KA,2005. Liu X,2004. Perrenoud A, Sauer U,2005. Iyer MS, Pal A, Srinivasan S, Somvanshi PR, Venkatesh KV,2021</a>.

Distinct functional roles for both regulators have been proposed, and it has been shown that there is little direct coregulation of the two <a title="24146625" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Park DM,2013</a>.

ArcA is a response regulator and is activated as a DNA-binding protein by phosphorylation <a title="11527965" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Jeon Y, Lee YS, Han JS, Kim JB, Hwang DS,2001</a>.

Iuchi S,1992</a>. Under anaerobic conditions ArcA is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from the autophosphorylated transmitter domain of ArcB to the receiver and Hpt domain of ArcB and finally to the receiver domain of ArcA <a title="10851007, 8825099, 9286997" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kwon O,2000.

ArcA is a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators and consists of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain  <a title="9205844" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Mizuno T,1997</a>.

This regulator belongs to the LysR family. NhaR is composed of two domains: the amino-terminal domain, which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is possibly responsible for inducer binding <a title="3413113" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Henikoff S,1988</a>. In systematic studies of oligomerization, it was shown that some members of the LysR family, like NhaR, interact with other members of the family to form heterodimers, but the physiological significance of this is unknown <a title="21187915" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Knapp GS, Hu JC,2010</a>.

The binding targets for NhaR are 17 nucleotides long. Each dimer binds to one of these conserved sequences.

ECK120011383	Lrp	15	inverted-repeat	AsnC		ECK12	Lrp, "<b>L</b>eucine-responsive <b>r</b>egulatory <b>p</b>rotein," is a dual transcriptional regulator for at least 10% of the genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS: [12374860]|. These genes are involved in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism, nutrient transport, pili synthesis, and other cellular functions, including 1-carbon metabolism |CITS: [1346534][12675791][7968922]|. In addition, Lrp affects nearly three-fourths of the genes induced upon entry into stationary phase |CITS: [12374860][19052235]|. Lrp might also play a topological role in dynamic DNA packaging |CITS: [8212136]|.  Lrp can act as a repressor or activator for its target genes. Binding of leucine can affect these activities in three different ways: leucine either potentiates, antagonizes, or has no discernible effect upon Lrp action |CITS: [1532173][8432705][8561478]|. It is believed that Lrp senses the presence of rich nutrition based on the concentration of leucine and positively regulates genes that function during famine and negatively regulates genes that function during a feast |CITS: [7968922]|.  Lrp forms a mixture of octamers and hexadecamers |CITS: [11575919]|. In the presence of leucine, the octamer configuration is favored. It is believed that the switch between the octameric and hexadecameric states modulated by leucine affects the binding and the activity of Lrp at its target genes |CITS: [12054800]|. The structure of Lrp from <i>Escherichia coli</i> bound to DNA as an octamer has been solved |CITS: [17223133]|. Lrp forms an open ring structure, in which the DNA is wrapped around the octamer in a nucleosome-like structure. The monomer chain contains two domains, an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal &alpha;&beta;-sandwich fold.   The N-terminal is responsible for the specificity and function among members of the Lrp regulon across the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. The N-terminal tail plays a significant role in modulating Lrp function, similar to what has been reported for a number of other transcriptional regulators |CITS: [21642464]|.  N-terminal diversity is responsible for some of the differences between Lrp TF orthologs in terms of DNA binding and multimerization |CITS: [21642464]|.  Lrp-regulated promoters commonly contain multiple adjacent binding sites for the protein with low sequence specificity. A consensus recognition sequence has been described |CITS: [8636076]|. The identified 15-bp sequence motif is structured with flanking CAG/CTG triplets and a central AT-rich signal. Leucine has two effects upon binding to DNA <i>in vitro</i>: the affinity of Lrp is reduced but the cooperativity of binding to multiple sites is increased |CITS: [15571719]|.  It has been observed that in <i>E. coli</i> the major stability and affinity of Lrp to DNA is at neutral pH conditions, although the cooperativity increases as the pH declines |CITS: [34228496]|. However, it appears that Lrp can be adapted to other conditions in other bacteria, such as Lrp of <i>Komagataeibacter europaeus</i>, which is more stable and functional under acidic pH |CITS: [34228496]|.  Lrp belongs to the Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, which is widely distributed throughout the eubacterial and archaeal domains. Lrp appears to be very well conserved in members of the &gamma;-proteobacteria |CITS: [12675791]|. Based on phylogenetic and Logo analysis, a conserved signature in the Lrp TF and its paralog, AscN, were identified in &gamma;-proteobacteria |CITS: [27206730]|. Likewise, specific residues that correlated with global versus local regulatory roles were determined |CITS: [27206730]|.  A microarray analysis for Lrp of <i>Escherichia coli</i> was done by |CITS: [12130640]|.  Based on whole-proteome analysis, three lysines (K28, K39, and K132) were identified as points of acetylation |CITS: [24917678]|.  Under ampicillin treatment, the activity of Lrp appears to increase |CITS: [33731833]|.

ECK120011400	PspF	17	inverted-repeat	EBP		ECK12	The transcription factor PspF, for "<b>P</b>hage <b>s</b>hock <b>p</b>rotein <b>F</b>," is a bacterial enhancer-binding protein required for &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcription activation |CITS: [17157497][8606168]|. This regulator activates the transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon, and it is negatively autoregulated and coordinately activated by transcription of the divergent operon <i>psp</i> |CITS: [15485810][8606168][9260970]|. The integration host factor facilitates control of the <i>psp</i> regulon |CITS: [9302010][9344746][15485810]|.  The <i>psp</i> regulon is defined like the phage shock protein system, which is involved in protecting the bacterium during infectious processes |CITS: [15485810][8606168]|. The synthesis of this regulon is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown under different extracytoplasmic stress conditions and upon infection by filamentous phage (phage shock) |CITS: [1717346][16709570][9159513][16045608][1712397][9493373]|.   The activity of PspF is inhibited by PspA, which is an accessory protein that binds directly to PspF to inhibit transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon |CITS: [12079332][1717346][29906279]|. PspA inhibits PspF activity by direct interaction of the AAA+ transcription activation domain of PspF |CITS: [12079332]|. Although PspA appears to regulate transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon, it does not bind to DNA , but it is necessary for repressing this regulon |CITS: [10629175]|.   PspA appears to bind to the W56 loop of PspF, which is a region that contains residues 50-62. This loop contains a group of three amino acids, called the YLW patch, that serve as a docking site for PspA and for ATP hydrolytic activity |CITS: [ 23659791]|. The PspF-PspA complex is mainly located in the nucleoid; however, this complex is able to frequently travel from the nucleoid to the membrane to sense changes in the membrane that result from some types of stress |CITS: [23764692]|.  On the other hand, PspB and PspC together act cooperatively to activate transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon by blocking the interaction between PspA and PspF |CITS: [1717346][7596833]|. PspC is essential for this activation, whereas PspB is not strictly required |CITS: [1717346]|. PspA, PspB, and PspC form a complex, and PspC is required for PspA to bind to PspB |CITS: [12562786]|. PspA, PspB, and PspC are not observed to cross-link with PspD |CITS: [12562786]|.   The PspF AAA+ domain interacts with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> in the presence of a compound that mimics the transition state of ATP hydrolysis |CITS: [11544185]|. The AAA+ domain may directly contact DNA while promoting open complex formation |CITS: [15333692]|. Detailed analysis of the role of the C7 and the C3 regions of PspF has been presented with respect to ATP hydrolysis, protein oligomerization, binding to the &sigma;<sup>54</sup> holoenzyme, and transcription activation |CITS: [12186874]|.  A conformational change in PspF is observed in the presence of ATP |CITS: [12186874]|. ATPase activity may result in transient presentation of the site that interacts with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> |CITS: [12601152]|. Steps leading to open complex formation at the promoter have been examined using PspF and various nucleoside analogs |CITS: [12649285]|.   Expression of <i>pspF</i> is negatively autoregulated |CITS: [9150200][8606168][9260970][9302010][9344746]|. The stability of <i>pspF</i> mRNA is enhanced by a RIB element (bacterial interspersed mosaic element) in the 3'-flanking region of the <i>pspF</i> transcript |CITS: [9150200]|.  The PspF protein belongs to the enhancer-binding protein family of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activators (bEBPs). PspF is composed of two domains: the N-terminal catalytic domain, common to members of the AAA+ protein family (ATPase associated with various cellular activities), and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain |CITS: [8606168]|. PspF does not contain a regulatory domain typical for other bEBP proteins; instead, its activity is negatively controlled by PspA acting in <i>trans</i> |CITS: [10629175][15838051][12079332]|.  The mechano-chemical coupling in bEBPs requires distinct activities of the AAA+ subunits |CITS: [25063294]|.  The catalytic AAA+ domain is necessary and sufficient to activate &sigma;<sup>54</sup> transcription <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Hexamerization is required for this function and does not require ATP, DNA, or the DNA-binding domain |CITS: [9878422][15111053][16973614][14659000]|. When assembled into a ring, the AAA+ domain uses the energy from ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release to remodel the &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase holoenzyme so that it can transition from the closed to the open complex. The AAA+ domain contains all conserved motifs of the AAA+ family, including Walkers A and B for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the second region of homology (SRH), which contains arginine fingers for intersubunit catalysis |CITS: [11473577][6329717][18208391]|. As a member of the bEBP family it carries two additional sequence insertions: the L1 loop containing the GAFTGA motif and the L2 loop (also termed the pre-SIi loop). The L1 loop is known to interact with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, presumably with region I of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>. Zhang et al. (2012) showed that L1 is multifunctional, since it interacts with three elements important for isomerization from RP<sub>c</sub> to RP<sub>o</sub> (the RNAP closed and open complexes, respectively). On one hand, L1 contacts the DNA nontemplate strand immediately upstream of the -24 promoter element, and on other hand, it contacts two PspF L1-binding sites, residues 18 to 25 and 33 to 39, within &sigma;<sup>54</sup> RI |CITS: [22772990]|. The GAFTGA motif is thought to communicate changes associated with ATP hydrolysis, leading to conformational rearrangements in the RNA polymerase closed complex and thereby promoting open complex formation |CITS: [17090527][15469519][19692583][12601152]|. The L2 loop is thought to coordinate movement of the L1 loop |CITS: [19486295][17242399]|.   Based on an engineered single-chain polypeptide, it was shown that the PspF hexamer functions asymmetrically, i.e., the individual subunits make different contributions to the activities of the oligomer, and only three subunits are necessary for engagement and remodeling of the target (&sigma;<sup>54</sup>) of the closed complex (RP<sub>c</sub> formation) |CITS: [21300807]|.

ECK120011412	MarA	20	asymmetric	AraC/XylS		ECK12	MarA, "<b>m</b>ultiple <b>a</b>ntibiotic <b>r</b>esistance" |CITS: [8383113]|, participates in controlling several genes involved in resistance to antibiotics |CITS:[32561799]|, oxidative stress |CITS: [10498949]|, organic solvents |CITS: [9324261][10498949][9097440]|, and heavy metals |CITS: [10498949]|. The antibiotic resistance associated with MarA appears to involve the acidification of the cytoplasm |CITS: [32561799]|.  MarA, SoxS, and Rob are paralogous transcriptional regulators that show 45% amino acid identity between them |CITS: [8383113]|; the crystal structures for Rob |CITS: [10802742 ]| and MarA |CITS: [9724717]| confirm this similarity between them. They activate a common set of genes, but the expression and activity of each one of these proteins are induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS: [11844771][12791142]|, and the transcription of MarA and SoxS is increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate |CITS: [11985714][31349991]| and oxidative stress |CITS: [8955629]|, respectively.  Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated only by one of them.  The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS: [14594836]|.  These three monomer proteins bind to the same DNA site, a degenerate 19-bp sequence known as the sox-mar-rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|.  In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the -35 box and are generally oriented in a backwards direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|. In a subset of the class I promoters the sox-mar-rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|.  For MarA it was shown that the extent of activation at different promoters is only poorly correlated with the strength of MarA binding to the specific mar box |CITS: [18514222]|. By using a computational model of transcriptional activation it was proposed that at the class I promoter of <i>mar</i> MarA increases the binding of RNA polymerase but not the occupancy. At the class II promoters of <i>sodA</i> and <i>micF</i> MarA can even decrease both RNA polymerase affinity and occupancy at the promoter. The model predicts that MarA increases the rate of transcription initiation while decreasing the overall presence of the transcription machinery at the promoter |CITS: [20019803]|.  The sox-mar-rob box contains an "invariant A" at position 1,  two recognition elements, the RE1 at postion 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp  A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS: [10802742][11724537][11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS: [11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS: [11985714]|. Based on these findings, it was proposed that these proteins activate the transcription by a mechanism named "DNA scanning" or "prerecruitment," which consists of the formation of the complex RNA polymerase transcriptional regulator in the absence of DNA, and then this complex scans the DNA to bind to appropriate sites |CITS: [11985714][11866462]|.  These three proteins belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS: [9409145]|, and as with other members of this family they have two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs for DNA binding, one of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the mar box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2 |CITS: [12217688][ 9724717][11724537]|. In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of two HTH motifs makes base-specific contact with DNA; this was observed for the micF promoter |CITS: [10802742]|. In order to decipher molecular details of the free and DNA-bound forms of Rob and MarA, some simulation analysis using native and mutant DNA binding sites and proteins has been performed |CITS: [34137249]|.  Cells carrying a mutation in <i>marA</i> at a glutamic acid residue (E89A) were able to express higher resistance to superoxides than those harboring wild-type <i>marA</i> |CITS: [21097628]|. Thus, MarA E89A acts more like SoxS than MarA in exhibiting greater activation and binding at the class I promoter |CITS: [21097628]|.

MarA, SoxS, and Rob are paralogous transcriptional regulators that show 45% amino acid identity between them <a title="8383113" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cohen SP,1993</a>; the crystal structures for Rob <a title="10802742" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kwon HJ,2000</a>| and MarA <a title="9724717" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rhee S, Martin RG, Rosner JL, Davies DR,1998</a> confirm this similarity between them. They activate a common set of genes, but the expression and activity of each one of these proteins are induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate <a title="11844771, 12791142" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rosner JL, Dangi B, Gronenborn AM, Martin RG,2002.

Wang T, Kunze C, Dunlop MJ,2019</a> and oxidative stress <a title="8955629" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Demple B,1996</a>, respectively.

Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated only by one of them.  The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites <a title="14594836" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pomposiello PJ,2003</a>.

These three monomer proteins bind to the same DNA site, a degenerate 19-bp sequence known as the sox-mar-rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter <a title="10564485, 10564484" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG,1999. Wood TI,1999</a>.  In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the -35 box and are generally oriented in a backwards direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction <a title="10564485, 10564484" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG,1999. Wood TI,1999</a>. In a subset of the class I promoters the sox-mar-rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation <a title="10564485, 10564484" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG,1999. Wood TI,1999</a>.

For MarA it was shown that the extent of activation at different promoters is only poorly correlated with the strength of MarA binding to the specific mar box <a title="18514222" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG, Bartlett ES, Rosner JL, Wall ME,2008</a>. By using a computational model of transcriptional activation it was proposed that at the class I promoter of <i>mar</i> MarA increases the binding of RNA polymerase but not the occupancy. At the class II promoters of <i>sodA</i> and <i>micF</i> MarA can even decrease both RNA polymerase affinity and occupancy at the promoter. The model predicts that MarA increases the rate of transcription initiation while decreasing the overall presence of the transcription machinery at the promoter <a title="20019803" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wall ME, Markowitz DA, Rosner JL, Martin RG,2009</a>.

The sox-mar-rob box contains an "invariant A" at position 1,  two recognition elements, the RE1 at postion 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp  A/T-rich spacer separating these elements <a title="10802742, 11724537, 11401718" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kwon HJ,2000. Dangi B,2001. Griffith KL,2001</a>. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome <a title="11866462" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Griffith KL, Shah IM, Myers TE, O'Neill MC, Wolf RE,2002</a>. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter <a title="11985714" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG, Gillette WK, Martin NI, Rosner JL,2002</a>. Based on these findings, it was proposed that these proteins activate the transcription by a mechanism named "DNA scanning" or "prerecruitment," which consists of the formation of the complex RNA polymerase transcriptional regulator in the absence of DNA, and then this complex scans the DNA to bind to appropriate sites <a title="11985714, 11866462" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG, Gillette WK, Martin NI, Rosner JL,2002. Griffith KL, Shah IM, Myers TE, O'Neill MC, Wolf RE,2002</a>.

These three proteins belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators <a title="9409145" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gallegos MT,1997</a>, and as with other members of this family they have two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs for DNA binding, one of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the mar box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2 <a title="12217688, 9724717, 11724537" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Griffith KL, Wolf RE,2002. Rhee S, Martin RG, Rosner JL, Davies DR,1998. Dangi B,2001</a>. In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of two HTH motifs makes base-specific contact with DNA; this was observed for the micF promoter <a title="10802742" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kwon HJ,2000</a>. In order to decipher molecular details of the free and DNA-bound forms of Rob and MarA, some simulation analysis using native and mutant DNA binding sites and proteins has been performed <a title="34137249" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Corbella M, Liao Q, Moreira C, Parracino A, Kasson PM, Kamerlin SCL,2021</a>.

Cells carrying a mutation in <i>marA</i> at a glutamic acid residue (E89A) were able to express higher resistance to superoxides than those harboring wild-type <i>marA</i> <a title="21097628" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG,2011</a>. Thus, MarA E89A acts more like SoxS than MarA in exhibiting greater activation and binding at the class I promoter <a title="21097628" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Martin RG,2011</a>.  The MarA hydrophobic core distant from their binding site is affected by single-site substitutions, altering its extent and specificity of DNA binding <a title="26301601" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Koulechova DA, Tripp KW, Horner G, Marqusee S,2015</a>.

In addition GadX also activates the transcription of the central activator involved in the acid response |CITS: [17660422]|. The physiological inducer is unknown. Richard et al. proposed that GadX can sense intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, but the mechanism is not known |CITS: [17768258]|.  GadX is one of the regulators of the acid resistance system and is encoded by the unusual <i>gadXW</i> operon, which is located in the region called the acid fitness island |CITS: [18808381]|. This operon encodes two transcriptional regulators, GadX and GadW, both of which are members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS: [9409145][11282467][18808381]|.   The activities of GadX and GadW are indispensable upon entry into the stationary phase in response to acid pH  |CITS: [11976288][12446650]|. In addition Tramonti et al. provided evidence that the transcription of the <i>gadXW</i> operon is regulated to a posttranscriptional level by a GadY small RNA |CITS: [18808381][15466020]|.  GadX is highly homologous to GadW (42%), and apparently both are capable of cross talk to regulate expression of the genes of this system |CITS: [18808381]|. Although little is known about the regulating mechanism of GadX, Tucker et al. proposed that this regulator and GadW have distinct molecular mechanisms |CITS: [12730179][16980449]|. These regulators form homodimers |CITS: [9409145]| and heterodimers |CITS: [12446650]| <i>in vivo</i>.  Currently, the  GadW/GadX-dependent circuit, involved in the GAD system, is under discussion and study.

The structure of the N-terminal receiver domain has been solved in the absence and presence of the phosphoryl analog beryllofluoride <a title="17545283" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bachhawat P, Stock AM,2007</a>. PhoP is phosphorylated and thereby activated by its cognate sensor kinase PhoQ at a low extracellular concentration of magnesium. At high levels of magnesium the phospho-PhoP phosphatase activity of the sensor protein is induced <a title="10807931" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Castelli ME, García Véscovi E, Soncini FC,2000</a>. Z nucleotides [ZMP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-monophosphate) and/or ZTP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5-triphosphate)] can act as direct phosphodonors to PhoP <i>in vivo</i>, activating it in a PhoQ-independent manner when they accumulate <a title="33318202" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Vazquez-Ciros OJ,2020</a>.

Regulation of the PhoQ/PhoP system is connected to the EvgS/EvgA system through the small inner membrane protein B1500. The EvgS/EvgA system is involved in acid resistance and directly regulates expression of B1500. B1500 interacts with PhoQ and increases the level of PhoP phosphorylation <a title="17998538" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Eguchi Y,2007</a>.

PhoP is not an essential protein, but when OmpR is removed from the cell along with PhoB or PhoP, cellular adaptative growth is disrupted. However, growth was not affected in a triple knockout involving <i>ompR</i>, <i>phoB</i>, and <i>phoP</i> <a title="32108145" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Miyake Y,2020</a>.

ECK120011502	NarL	7		LuxR/UhpA		ECK12	NarL, "nitrate/nitrite response regulator NarL," is a transcriptional dual regulator of many anaerobic electron transport and fermentation-related genes in the response to the availability of high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite |CITS: [9230919][7855431]|. NarL activates expression of 51 operons in response to nitrate, mostly genes needed for nitrate respiration. NarL represses 41 operons involved in alternative respiratory pathways, such as fumarate reduction or fermentation of simple sugars |CITS: [16377617]|.  The response regulator NarL belongs to the LuxR/UhpA family |CITS: [2559300][2314271]| and is part of the two-component system NarX-NarL. There is intensive cross-regulation with the paralogous two-component system NarQ-NarP |CITS: [12546643][8501030]|. Each of the sensors, NarX and NarQ, is able to phosphorylate NarL and NarP, leading to the activation of both proteins. In the absence of nitrate and nitrite, NarX and NarQ stimulate the dephosphorylation of NarL-P and NarP-P |CITS: [8051011][8473280]|. This reaction is specific, that is, NarL-P is only desphosphorylated by NarX. The system discriminates between nitrate and nitrite. In the presence of nitrate both sensors phosphorylate NarL and NarP to the same extent. In the presence of nitrite, NarX phosphorylates NarP but acts primarily as a phosphatase for NarL-P |CITS: [9426129][9006026][10464202]|. In contrast, NarQ phosphorylates NarL and NarP in response to both nitrate and nitrite. Therefore, NarL mainly serves as a nitrate regulator and is only weakly phosphorylated in the presence of nitrite |CITS: [10464202][10542156]|.  NarL consists of the N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The crystal structures of the monomeric full-length protein |CITS: [8780507][9521685]| and of the dimeric output domain bound to DNA |CITS: [12352954][16262254]| have been reported.  Based on the results of an EMSA and an <i>in vivo</i> expression assay, it was determined that the NarL OD (output domain) function has discrepant activities between NarL OD linkers. In the absence or presence of linker, the helix 6 constitutively represses<i>frdA</i>, and the presence of the linker loop 5-6 reverses this repression |CITS: [26307095]|.  On the other hand, previous DNase I footprint analyses of the<i>narG</i>promoter have revealed two areas of protection by NarL-P, with lower affinity centered at the 195 region |CITS: [8057356][7891552]|. It was also shown in a footprint assay that the NarL OD recognizes sites around the <i>narG</i> promoter, and optimal binding activities are induced when the RD (receiver domain) is phosphorylated; therefore, NarL RD phosphorylation acts as an on-off switch for increasing the DNA-binding affinity |CITS: [26307095]|. Finally, based on an analytical ultracentrifugation study, it was shown that NarL phosphorylation results in RD dimer formation in solution, while the OD is monomeric; both events are completely necessary for stimulating transcription |CITS: [26307095]|.   In unphosphorylated NarL, the DNA-binding site of the output domain is blocked by the receiver domain |CITS: [8780507]|. Phosphorylation induces the separation of both domains, resulting in the exposure of previously inaccessible DNA-binding residues and the formation of a new dimerization interface in the C-terminal domain |CITS: [12484754][12614149]|.  The receiver domain of NarL and NarP could function as a stabilizer of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD); it enhances DNA binding and/or enables repression per se <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, the receiver may make protein-protein contacts necessary for transcription activation |CITS: [20634237]|. NarL (E273 residue) appears to interact directly with the RNA polymerase (&alpha;-CTD) to activate the transcription of the ogt promoter |CITS: [32662815]|.  The NarL consensus recognition sequence consists of a 7-bp element, termed the NarL heptamer |CITS: [8437517][8736541]|. A subset of NarL-binding sites, in which two inverted repeats of the heptamer are separated by 2 bp (termed 7-2-7 sites), also represents binding sites for NarP |CITS: [9302020][7854119]|. Therefore, the NarL and NarP regulons overlap. NarL-binding heptamers are found as single copies, inverted repeats, or direct repeats at positions between +20 and -200 relative to the transcriptional start sites |CITS: [7643383]|. Most NarL-dependent promoters are also codependent on the oxygen sensor FNR, IHF, or Fis, implying that multiprotein complexes are involved in the transcriptional regulation of NarL target promoters |CITS: [16936015][9484902][10972841][15225315][11929525]|.  The Nar sites are classified based on the location of the activator binding site (ref). Nar class I promoters have a single Nar-binding site immediately adjacent to the promoter |CITS: [17720788][19245365][16199562]|, and Nar class II promoters have two Nar-binding sites upstream of the promoter |CITS: [20634237]| and reference therein.  The accumulation of the protein NarL is decreased during iron-limiting conditions |CITS: [31235512]|.  Under ampicillin treatment, the activity of NarL appears to increase |CITS: [33731833]|.  A review of the regulation of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis and molybdoenzyme gene expression via molybdenum and iron by FNR, NarXL/QP, Fur, and ArcA has been published |CITS:[31517366]|.

FadR coordinately regulates fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation at the level of transcription |CITS: [8446033]|. In this way, FadR functions as a switch between fatty acid &beta;-oxidation and fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS: [11279025]|.  FadR is a global regulator of lipid metabolism and a global regulator of fatty acid (FA) metabolism, acting both as a repressor of catabolism and an activator of anabolism, two directly opposing pathways, degradation and synthesis |CITS: [25802297]|. FadR activates the <i>fabH</i> promoter in the absence of long-chain FA |CITS: [23772072]|. Multiple promoters seem to be a common feature of FA synthesis genes |CITS: [25802297]|.  FadR belongs to the GntR family |CITS: [11013219][2060763]|. However, Xu et al. (2001) reported that homologies to CAP and the Tet repressor based on structure are more relevant and they have categorized FadR as a chimera of two motifs |CITS: [11279025]|.  FadR appears to be a two-domain dimeric molecule in which the N-terminal domains |CITS: [7836365][9388199][1569108][2843809]| bind to DNA, whereas the C-terminal domain binds the fatty acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) |CITS: [11279025]|. In addition, there is a linker that connects both the N-terminal and C-terminal. FadR binds DNA as an apo-protein, and it is released when it binds long-chain acyl-CoA |CITS: [9767562][32184249]|.

ECK120011897	IclR	7		IclR		ECK12	The transcription factor IclR, for "<b>I</b>so<b>c</b>itrate <b>l</b>yase <b>R</b>egulator," is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[8550439]| and it regulates the expression of the glyoxylate bypass operon  |CITS:[18942160][8626344][1995429][2512996][7033207][2001680]|. Transcription of this operon is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown during acetate accumulation in the exponential phase. Glyoxylate and pyruvate have been identified as effectors of IclR and show antagonistic effects. While glyoxylate favors the inactive dimeric state of IclR, pyruvate increases the binding of IclR to the aceBp promoter by stabilizing the active tetrameric form of the protein |CITS:[17426033]|.  On other hand, the genes of the <i>aceBAK</i> operon are expressed to varied degrees due to two facts: first, they are differentially regulated at the translational level, and second, there is a putative premature transcriptional termination in the region preceding the <i>aceK</i> gene |CITS:[16415587]|.    IclR represses <i>aceBAK</i> transcription through two mechanisms |CITS:[12492863]|: (1) binding to the proximal site, overlapping the -35 promoter box, and preventing RNA polymerase binding |CITS:[8682810][1447784][2001680]|, and (2) binding to the distal site after the RNA polymerase has bound to the promoter and formed the open complex, avoiding the polymerase escape of the promoter through its interaction with the &alpha;-subunits. Perhaps the IclR binding at both sites forms an intermolecular bridge that leads to a DNA loop structure and thus enhances the <i>aceBAK</i>  repression |CITS:[12492863]|.  This regulator belongs to the IclR family of repressors. IclR is composed of two domains: the amino-terminal domain, which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is responsible for inducer binding |CITS:[1447784][2185227][17426033][8844850][1995431]|.  The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of IclR (2.3&Aring;) has been solved  |CITS:[17426033]|.

ECK120011903	DnaA	9		DnaA		ECK12	DnaA is the linchpin element in the initiation of DNA replication in <i>E. coli</i>. It initiates the process of replication by binding to the origin of replication (<i>oriC</i>). This opens the origin to provide access to single-stranded DNA for the replicative helicase DnaB and its associated loading protein, DnaC, creating the two replication forks that will move outward as DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA. DnaA is a central focus for regulation of this initiation process, maintaining the critical ratio of one initiation of DNA replication per cell division. As a consequence, a number of factors feed into the regulation of both DnaA abundance and activity, yielding an integrated control over this core cellular process.   Recent reviews: |CITS: [24747048][29312202][29357054][29541066][33245995][34345967]|  DnaA interacts with <i>oriC</i> via binding at short DNA sequences known as "DnaA boxes" |CITS: [7615570][2542031][6091903][6310593][9297181]|. Prior to the start of the replication initiation process, DnaA monomers are bound to three high-affinity sites within <i>oriC</i>. As the replication initiation process begins, DnaA oligomerizes, apparently "spidering out" from these high-affinity sites to facilitate binding of the low-affinity DnaA boxes |CITS: [19833870][10234818][9351837]|. IHF binds at the same time as this shift from high- to low-affinity sites occurs, enhancing binding by DnaA to these low-affinity boxes |CITS: [10692160][12366835]|. DnaA-ATP binds with somewhat greater affinity to the general <i>oriC</i> region than DnaA-ADP |CITS: [11250912]|. This appears to be the consequence of a handful of "initiator" or DnaA boxes within <i>oriC</i> which have a four-fold higher affinity for DnaA-ATP over DnaA-ADP |CITS: [14978287][16298387]|. In line with the model of these particular DnaA boxes being gatekeepers for initiation of replication, <i>E. coli</i> win which normal DnaA boxes have been replaced with additional "initiator" sequences are subject to asynchronous and overly frequent replication initiation |CITS: [17850252]|. More generally, all the DnaA boxes in <i>oriC</i> play a role in proper regulation of initiation, as does their spacing and orientation |CITS: [8858585][7667087][8022267][1603077][1291230][2830261]|.   The transition between the "closed" and "open" origin is made sharper by the coordinated action of Fis, IHF, and DnaA. Fis initially blocks access by both IHF and DnaA, but as DnaA abundance increases, Fis is kicked off and IHF and DnaA bind the remaining DnaA boxes <i>en masse</i>, starting the opening process |CITS: [14982629]|. Once <i>oriC</i> has begun to unwind, DnaA-ATP binds with significantly higher affinity to the newly revealed single-stranded DNA than to the remaining double-stranded DNA, whereas DnaA-ADP shows no difference in affinity |CITS: [11250912]|.  After unwinding the double helix at <i>oriC</i>, DnaA faciliates the loading of the replicative helicase DnaB onto two nascent replication forks. DnaA binds to DnaB, bringing it into the area of the unwound <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [8106460][627535]|. The complete "prepriming complex" involves 10 DnaA monomers and 2 DnaB hexamers per <i>oriC</i>, meaning that there is one replicative helicase (DnaB hexamer) per new replication fork |CITS: [11551962]|. Although the binding of DnaB and its loader to the <i>oriC</i> region depends on having available single-stranded DNA from the newly unwound helix, DnaA binding does not, meaning that in the prepriming complex DnaA monomers are bound to both the wound and unwound regions of the origin |CITS: [12161435]|. Although there will eventually be a helicase loaded onto each replication fork, loading that is directly attributable to the DnaA-DnaB interaction only occurs on one of the two strands |CITS: [12421318]|. Presumably the replication bubble is effectively "held open" by the first helicase loaded, allowing access for a second one.   Following the generation of this <i>oriC</i>-DnaB prepriming complex, DnaA's role in initiation is complete and it is no longer required |CITS: [2153124]|.  DnaA oligomerizes extensively as part of carrying out its role in initiating replication |CITS: [15878847]|. The final prepriming complex has been reported to comprise 10-30 DnaA monomers, with complete occupancy of all <i>oriC</i> DnaA boxes |CITS: [11551962][8663334][12864864]|. As described above, this oligomerization process appears to start with binding at high-affinity DnaA boxes followed by "spidering" out to lower-affinity sites across the whole of <i>oriC</i>. Proper oligomerization and subsequent opening of <i>oriC</i> depends on DiaA, which forms a tetramer that binds multiple DnaA monomers, suggesting that DiaA may act as a coordinator of DnaA oligomers |CITS: [15326179][17699754]|. DiaA appears unlikely to be part of some sort of DnaA-DiaA complex, as DiaA blocks DnaB loading, implying that at some point after oligomerization of DnaA, DiaA exits the picture |CITS: [19632993]|.  Initiation of DNA replication has been proposed to be regulated by several mechanisms that operate through DnaA and <i>oriC</i>. These include control over the ATP/ADP status of DnaA, sequestering of the origin of replication, and titration of available DnaA.  The ATP- versus ADP-bound status of DnaA has a major impact on its ability to operate as an initiator of DNA replication. Although DnaA binds both ATP and ADP with high affinity, only the ATP-bound form is able to initiate replication under normal circumstances, as described above |CITS: [3036372][9125116][2835363]|. This difference is not due to binding, as both forms can bind at <i>oriC</i>, but instead is a function of DnaA-ATP being the only form with the ability to prompt unwinding of the double helix |CITS: [8377183]|. Averaged across the entire cell cycle, some 15-30% of all DnaA is typically in ATP-bound form. This abundance rises across the course of the cell cycle, topping out at about 80% just ahead of DNA division and cell division |CITS: [10581238]|.  The primary limiter of the abundance of DnaA-ATP is the DnaA regulator Hda, acting in concert with the beta clamp of DNA Pol III |CITS: [7721846][9473485][9674428][10581238][16882985]|. Hda acts as a bridge between the beta clamp of the polymerase and DnaA. Two Hda homodimers bind per clamp via the Hda amino-terminus, and then Hda interacts with DnaA via the DnaA amino-terminus. When this complexing occurs, ATP hydrolysis is stimulated, converting DnaA-ATP to DnaA-ADP |CITS: [15150238][15611053][11254969]|. ATP hydrolysis is inhibited when DnaA is bound to a DnaA box, but this inhibition is overcome by Hda-clamp binding and active DNA synthesis |CITS: [15189445][11309120]|. This suggests that either this interaction is tethering DnaA to non-DnaA-box DNA, or that it may let the DNA polymerase complex drag DnaA off of a DnaA box. This conversion of DnaA-ATP to its ADP state is required to prevent  premature or asynchronous initiation of DNA replication |CITS: [15939703][16041320][16321957][12730188][11483528]|.  DnaA-ADP is regenerated to its ATP-bound form via an interaction with phospholipids. Cardiolipin and various unsaturated fatty acids in relatively fluid membranes dissociate ADP from DnaA, leaving DnaA available for binding by new ATP |CITS: [2835364][8227025]|. Phospholipids lacking unsaturated fatty acids only poorly promote the release of ADP |CITS: [2845401]|. DnaA binding to <i>oriC</i> is important for stabilizing the protein during this process |CITS: [1512219]|. Conversely, the presence of various phospholipids in advance of binding blocks <i>oriC</i> binding by DnaA |CITS: [12366847]|. The carboxy-terminal portion of DnaA appears to actually enter the membrane during this regeneration process |CITS: [9478970]|. This aligns well with the observation that DnaA localizes to the cell membrane |CITS: [10762265]|.  The regeneration of DnaA-ADP to DnaA-ATP is also promoted by two intergenic regions on the chromosome labeled DARS1 and DARS2. Each of these regions contains many DnaA sites, promoting the oligomerization of DnaA in such a manner as to enhance the release of ADP |CITS: [19401329]|.  Newly synthesized DNA within <i>oriC</I> and the nearby <i>dnaA</i> locus remains hemimethylated significantly longer than other newly synthesized DNA. This was originally proposed as a mechanism of delaying initiation of new DNA replication, as hemimethylated DNA is not transcription competent |CITS: [1697508]|. Based on analyses carried out using <i>oriC</i> DNA on a plasmid SeqA was observed to bind this hemimethylated DNA and inhibit DnaA binding |CITS: [11122375]|. However, mutants lacking any <I>seqA</i> activity see only a modest increase in initiation of replication, and methylation state of sites within the <i>dnaA</i> promoter region has no impact on replication timing |CITS: [16041320][16740964]|. It does appear that SeqA facilitates <i>oriC</i> reset by blocking access of DnaA to the low-affinity DnaA boxes that are typically only occupied during the initiation of replication |CITS: [17114060]|.  There are a number of other DnaA boxes throughout the <i>E. coli</i> genome beyond those within contained <i>oriC</i> and the DARS regions. One theory of regulation of DnaA activity as an initiator of DNA replication is that DnaA monomers are titrated out by binding to many of these alternate DnaA boxes. The major proposed DnaA titration site is datA. The datA site contains multiple DnaA boxes, and titrates out DnaA in a box-dependent manner. Mutations within this site lead to asynchronous and overly frequent initiation of DNA replicatio|CITS: [9765205][11690638][12068813]|. When additional datA sites are introduced into <I>E. coli</i>, DNA replication and cell division are delayed, followed by an induced SOS response and incomplete replication at especially high doses of datA |CITS: [14507385]|. However, given that cells are viable and DNA replication can be initiated in the absence of a datA site, it has been suggested that the role of datA titration of DnaA is in timing of initiation relative to cell growth, rather than in blocking incorrect initiation completely |CITS: [15939703][16041320]|. The DnaA boxes involved in titrating DnaA are structurally distinct from those involved in binding of oligomeric DnaA to <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [17316685]|. However, much like <i>oriC</i>, the DnaA boxes within datA contain an interstitial IHF binding region which must be intact to allow proper function of datA in regulating replication initiation |CITS: [19170757]|.  DnaA is presented at approximately 800-2,100 molecules per cell. Although this number varies across different <i>E. coli</i> strains, it appears to be fairly consistent across differing growth conditions within a given strain |CITS: [1860829]|. The amount of DnaA per cell was decreased/increased in strains that were deleted for or overproduced RstA, respectively. RstA may regulate the expression of <i>dnaA</i> and indirectly affect DNA replication |CITS:[30011323]|.  DnaA is involved in a number of processes beyond cellular DNA replication. DnaA is required for replication of many plasmids, including pSC101, pBR322, ColE1, F plasmid, R1, RK2, and mini-F plasmids such as pSC183, pKP1013, and pKV513 |CITS: [6091903][3020005][3931918][3037524][2820940][2844794]|. Mutations in <i>dnaA</I> can also lead to a decrease in linking number in resident plasmids |CITS: [8573119]|. It is also involved in the life cycle of phages such as f1, lambda, and Coliphage 186, as well as being required for robust Tn5 transposition |CITS: [4601460][7033562][2820938][7867947][9819062]|.  DnaA belongs to the DnaA family of transcriptional regulators and it is subject to autoregulation, as increased abundance of DnaA represses transcription of <i>dnaA</i> |CITS: [2995766][2981626][3025553][2828882][8407830]|. This occurs via binding of DnaA to DnaA boxes at the <i>dnaA</i> locus, where the DnaA-DnaA box complex directly blocks transcription |CITS: [2854096][2548849][2088506][8995231]|. An internal DnaA box within the actual <i>dnaA</i> gene appears to play no role in modulating transcription, however, and it has been suggested that at least one other DnaA box at the locus is also dispensible for autoregulation |CITS: [7896719][9106220]|.  DnaA and LexA may coordinate DNA replication with DNA repair, and the control mode may be conserved within Gram-negative bacteria |CITS:[29967594]|. A model for control of the SOS regulon by DnaA and LexA is proposed where both DnaA and LexA repress expression of the SOS genes when SOS is off |CITS:[29967594]|.  Binding of DnaA to other DnaA boxes can similarly impact regulation of other genes, including <i>rpoH</i> and <i>guaA</i> |CITS: [2540187][1736096]|.  The structure of DnaA has been examined in great detail, with an emphasis on how it relates to DnaA's function within the cell.  The amino-terminal portion of DnaA is required for replication, but not for ATP or <i>oriC</i> binding |CITS: [9852089]|. This requirement for replication is likely due to the fact that the amino-terminal domain is both necessary and sufficient for oligomerization of DnaA, and is required for the interaction between DnaA and DnaB |CITS: [10540285][10972842]|. The amino-terminal region contains a number of residues whose hydrophobicity is required for proper DnaA function |CITS: [12132668]|. The flexible linker Domain II within DnaA has been evaluated via systematic deletion, revealing a minimum length requirement of 21-27 residues |CITS: [18957591]|. This domain is required for recruiting DnaB to <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [19546317]|. The Box VII domain within DnaA is required for oligomerization |CITS: [15371441]|. Phospholipid binding occurs via the region comprising residues 115-381 |CITS: [8670850][11102450]|. This region is an amphipathic helix that inserts into the membrane to activate the release of ADP |CITS: [9786858]|. ATP binding takes place near K415, R328, and K372 |CITS: [11700030][11853554]|. The carboxy-terminal 94 amino acids are both necessary and sufficient for binding to DnaA boxes in general and <i>oriC</i> in particular. This binding domain contains three &alpha; helices |CITS: [7744016][9417934][10844646]|.   Circular dichroism and NMR analysis of the DNA-binding domain of DnaA has been carried out |CITS: [12435387]|. NMR analysis has also identified the specific binding surface within this DNA binding domain |CITS: [14523560]|. The DnaA amino-terminal region has also been evaluated via NMR |CITS: [17420252]|.  The crystal structure of DnaA's DNA-binding domain complexed with an example DnaA box has been resolved to 2.1 &Aring; resolution |CITS: [12682358]|.  An experimental molecular weight of 48 kD has also been reported for DnaA |CITS: [6258023]|.  The ectopic expression of a mutant of DnaA (L366K) restores the cellular growth that is caused by the accumulation of the unprocessed outer membrane |FRAME: CPLX0-8279| Lpp (pro-Lpp) |CITS: [34163454]|. This growth restoration appears to be a consequence of the repression of pro-Lpp expression by the |FRAME:RNA0-386 |  |CITS: [34163454]|.

Recent reviews: |CITS: [24747048][29312202][29357054][29541066][33245995][34345967]|

DnaA interacts with <i>oriC</i> via binding at short DNA sequences known as "DnaA boxes" |CITS: [7615570][2542031][6091903][6310593][9297181]|. Prior to the start of the replication initiation process, DnaA monomers are bound to three high-affinity sites within <i>oriC</i>. As the replication initiation process begins, DnaA oligomerizes, apparently "spidering out" from these high-affinity sites to facilitate binding of the low-affinity DnaA boxes |CITS: [19833870][10234818][9351837]|. IHF binds at the same time as this shift from high- to low-affinity sites occurs, enhancing binding by DnaA to these low-affinity boxes |CITS: [10692160][12366835]|. DnaA-ATP binds with somewhat greater affinity to the general <i>oriC</i> region than DnaA-ADP |CITS: [11250912]|. This appears to be the consequence of a handful of "initiator" or DnaA boxes within <i>oriC</i> which have a four-fold higher affinity for DnaA-ATP over DnaA-ADP |CITS: [14978287][16298387]|. In line with the model of these particular DnaA boxes being gatekeepers for initiation of replication, <i>E. coli</i> win which normal DnaA boxes have been replaced with additional "initiator" sequences are subject to asynchronous and overly frequent replication initiation |CITS: [17850252]|. More generally, all the DnaA boxes in <i>oriC</i> play a role in proper regulation of initiation, as does their spacing and orientation |CITS: [8858585][7667087][8022267][1603077][1291230][2830261]|. 

The transition between the "closed" and "open" origin is made sharper by the coordinated action of Fis, IHF, and DnaA. Fis initially blocks access by both IHF and DnaA, but as DnaA abundance increases, Fis is kicked off and IHF and DnaA bind the remaining DnaA boxes <i>en masse</i>, starting the opening process |CITS: [14982629]|. Once <i>oriC</i> has begun to unwind, DnaA-ATP binds with significantly higher affinity to the newly revealed single-stranded DNA than to the remaining double-stranded DNA, whereas DnaA-ADP shows no difference in affinity |CITS: [11250912]|.

After unwinding the double helix at <i>oriC</i>, DnaA faciliates the loading of the replicative helicase DnaB onto two nascent replication forks. DnaA binds to DnaB, bringing it into the area of the unwound <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [8106460][627535]|. The complete "prepriming complex" involves 10 DnaA monomers and 2 DnaB hexamers per <i>oriC</i>, meaning that there is one replicative helicase (DnaB hexamer) per new replication fork |CITS: [11551962]|. Although the binding of DnaB and its loader to the <i>oriC</i> region depends on having available single-stranded DNA from the newly unwound helix, DnaA binding does not, meaning that in the prepriming complex DnaA monomers are bound to both the wound and unwound regions of the origin |CITS: [12161435]|. Although there will eventually be a helicase loaded onto each replication fork, loading that is directly attributable to the DnaA-DnaB interaction only occurs on one of the two strands |CITS: [12421318]|. Presumably the replication bubble is effectively "held open" by the first helicase loaded, allowing access for a second one. 

Following the generation of this <i>oriC</i>-DnaB prepriming complex, DnaA's role in initiation is complete and it is no longer required |CITS: [2153124]|.

DnaA oligomerizes extensively as part of carrying out its role in initiating replication |CITS: [15878847]|. The final prepriming complex has been reported to comprise 10-30 DnaA monomers, with complete occupancy of all <i>oriC</i> DnaA boxes |CITS: [11551962][8663334][12864864]|. As described above, this oligomerization process appears to start with binding at high-affinity DnaA boxes followed by "spidering" out to lower-affinity sites across the whole of <i>oriC</i>. Proper oligomerization and subsequent opening of <i>oriC</i> depends on DiaA, which forms a tetramer that binds multiple DnaA monomers, suggesting that DiaA may act as a coordinator of DnaA oligomers |CITS: [15326179][17699754]|. DiaA appears unlikely to be part of some sort of DnaA-DiaA complex, as DiaA blocks DnaB loading, implying that at some point after oligomerization of DnaA, DiaA exits the picture |CITS: [19632993]|.

Initiation of DNA replication has been proposed to be regulated by several mechanisms that operate through DnaA and <i>oriC</i>. These include control over the ATP/ADP status of DnaA, sequestering of the origin of replication, and titration of available DnaA.

The ATP- versus ADP-bound status of DnaA has a major impact on its ability to operate as an initiator of DNA replication. Although DnaA binds both ATP and ADP with high affinity, only the ATP-bound form is able to initiate replication under normal circumstances, as described above |CITS: [3036372][9125116][2835363]|. This difference is not due to binding, as both forms can bind at <i>oriC</i>, but instead is a function of DnaA-ATP being the only form with the ability to prompt unwinding of the double helix |CITS: [8377183]|. Averaged across the entire cell cycle, some 15-30% of all DnaA is typically in ATP-bound form. This abundance rises across the course of the cell cycle, topping out at about 80% just ahead of DNA division and cell division |CITS: [10581238]|.

The primary limiter of the abundance of DnaA-ATP is the DnaA regulator Hda, acting in concert with the beta clamp of DNA Pol III |CITS: [7721846][9473485][9674428][10581238][16882985]|. Hda acts as a bridge between the beta clamp of the polymerase and DnaA. Two Hda homodimers bind per clamp via the Hda amino-terminus, and then Hda interacts with DnaA via the DnaA amino-terminus. When this complexing occurs, ATP hydrolysis is stimulated, converting DnaA-ATP to DnaA-ADP |CITS: [15150238][15611053][11254969]|. ATP hydrolysis is inhibited when DnaA is bound to a DnaA box, but this inhibition is overcome by Hda-clamp binding and active DNA synthesis |CITS: [15189445][11309120]|. This suggests that either this interaction is tethering DnaA to non-DnaA-box DNA, or that it may let the DNA polymerase complex drag DnaA off of a DnaA box. This conversion of DnaA-ATP to its ADP state is required to prevent  premature or asynchronous initiation of DNA replication |CITS: [15939703][16041320][16321957][12730188][11483528]|.

DnaA-ADP is regenerated to its ATP-bound form via an interaction with phospholipids. Cardiolipin and various unsaturated fatty acids in relatively fluid membranes dissociate ADP from DnaA, leaving DnaA available for binding by new ATP |CITS: [2835364][8227025]|. Phospholipids lacking unsaturated fatty acids only poorly promote the release of ADP |CITS: [2845401]|. DnaA binding to <i>oriC</i> is important for stabilizing the protein during this process |CITS: [1512219]|. Conversely, the presence of various phospholipids in advance of binding blocks <i>oriC</i> binding by DnaA |CITS: [12366847]|. The carboxy-terminal portion of DnaA appears to actually enter the membrane during this regeneration process |CITS: [9478970]|. This aligns well with the observation that DnaA localizes to the cell membrane |CITS: [10762265]|.

The regeneration of DnaA-ADP to DnaA-ATP is also promoted by two intergenic regions on the chromosome labeled DARS1 and DARS2. Each of these regions contains many DnaA sites, promoting the oligomerization of DnaA in such a manner as to enhance the release of ADP |CITS: [19401329]|.

Newly synthesized DNA within <i>oriC</I> and the nearby <i>dnaA</i> locus remains hemimethylated significantly longer than other newly synthesized DNA. This was originally proposed as a mechanism of delaying initiation of new DNA replication, as hemimethylated DNA is not transcription competent |CITS: [1697508]|. Based on analyses carried out using <i>oriC</i> DNA on a plasmid SeqA was observed to bind this hemimethylated DNA and inhibit DnaA binding |CITS: [11122375]|. However, mutants lacking any <I>seqA</i> activity see only a modest increase in initiation of replication, and methylation state of sites within the <i>dnaA</i> promoter region has no impact on replication timing |CITS: [16041320][16740964]|. It does appear that SeqA facilitates <i>oriC</i> reset by blocking access of DnaA to the low-affinity DnaA boxes that are typically only occupied during the initiation of replication |CITS: [17114060]|.

There are a number of other DnaA boxes throughout the <i>E. coli</i> genome beyond those within contained <i>oriC</i> and the DARS regions. One theory of regulation of DnaA activity as an initiator of DNA replication is that DnaA monomers are titrated out by binding to many of these alternate DnaA boxes. The major proposed DnaA titration site is datA. The datA site contains multiple DnaA boxes, and titrates out DnaA in a box-dependent manner. Mutations within this site lead to asynchronous and overly frequent initiation of DNA replicatio|CITS: [9765205][11690638][12068813]|. When additional datA sites are introduced into <I>E. coli</i>, DNA replication and cell division are delayed, followed by an induced SOS response and incomplete replication at especially high doses of datA |CITS: [14507385]|. However, given that cells are viable and DNA replication can be initiated in the absence of a datA site, it has been suggested that the role of datA titration of DnaA is in timing of initiation relative to cell growth, rather than in blocking incorrect initiation completely |CITS: [15939703][16041320]|. The DnaA boxes involved in titrating DnaA are structurally distinct from those involved in binding of oligomeric DnaA to <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [17316685]|. However, much like <i>oriC</i>, the DnaA boxes within datA contain an interstitial IHF binding region which must be intact to allow proper function of datA in regulating replication initiation |CITS: [19170757]|.

DnaA is presented at approximately 800-2,100 molecules per cell. Although this number varies across different <i>E. coli</i> strains, it appears to be fairly consistent across differing growth conditions within a given strain |CITS: [1860829]|. The amount of DnaA per cell was decreased/increased in strains that were deleted for or overproduced RstA, respectively. RstA may regulate the expression of <i>dnaA</i> and indirectly affect DNA replication |CITS:[30011323]|.

DnaA is involved in a number of processes beyond cellular DNA replication. DnaA is required for replication of many plasmids, including pSC101, pBR322, ColE1, F plasmid, R1, RK2, and mini-F plasmids such as pSC183, pKP1013, and pKV513 |CITS: [6091903][3020005][3931918][3037524][2820940][2844794]|. Mutations in <i>dnaA</I> can also lead to a decrease in linking number in resident plasmids |CITS: [8573119]|. It is also involved in the life cycle of phages such as f1, lambda, and Coliphage 186, as well as being required for robust Tn5 transposition |CITS: [4601460][7033562][2820938][7867947][9819062]|.

DnaA belongs to the DnaA family of transcriptional regulators and it is subject to autoregulation, as increased abundance of DnaA represses transcription of <i>dnaA</i> |CITS: [2995766][2981626][3025553][2828882][8407830]|. This occurs via binding of DnaA to DnaA boxes at the <i>dnaA</i> locus, where the DnaA-DnaA box complex directly blocks transcription |CITS: [2854096][2548849][2088506][8995231]|. An internal DnaA box within the actual <i>dnaA</i> gene appears to play no role in modulating transcription, however, and it has been suggested that at least one other DnaA box at the locus is also dispensible for autoregulation |CITS: [7896719][9106220]|.

DnaA and LexA may coordinate DNA replication with DNA repair, and the control mode may be conserved within Gram-negative bacteria |CITS:[29967594]|. A model for control of the SOS regulon by DnaA and LexA is proposed where both DnaA and LexA repress expression of the SOS genes when SOS is off |CITS:[29967594]|.

Binding of DnaA to other DnaA boxes can similarly impact regulation of other genes, including <i>rpoH</i> and <i>guaA</i> |CITS: [2540187][1736096]|.

The structure of DnaA has been examined in great detail, with an emphasis on how it relates to DnaA's function within the cell.

The amino-terminal portion of DnaA is required for replication, but not for ATP or <i>oriC</i> binding |CITS: [9852089]|. This requirement for replication is likely due to the fact that the amino-terminal domain is both necessary and sufficient for oligomerization of DnaA, and is required for the interaction between DnaA and DnaB |CITS: [10540285][10972842]|. The amino-terminal region contains a number of residues whose hydrophobicity is required for proper DnaA function |CITS: [12132668]|. The flexible linker Domain II within DnaA has been evaluated via systematic deletion, revealing a minimum length requirement of 21-27 residues |CITS: [18957591]|. This domain is required for recruiting DnaB to <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [19546317]|. The Box VII domain within DnaA is required for oligomerization |CITS: [15371441]|. Phospholipid binding occurs via the region comprising residues 115-381 |CITS: [8670850][11102450]|. This region is an amphipathic helix that inserts into the membrane to activate the release of ADP |CITS: [9786858]|. ATP binding takes place near K415, R328, and K372 |CITS: [11700030][11853554]|. The carboxy-terminal 94 amino acids are both necessary and sufficient for binding to DnaA boxes in general and <i>oriC</i> in particular. This binding domain contains three &alpha; helices |CITS: [7744016][9417934][10844646]|. 

Circular dichroism and NMR analysis of the DNA-binding domain of DnaA has been carried out |CITS: [12435387]|. NMR analysis has also identified the specific binding surface within this DNA binding domain |CITS: [14523560]|. The DnaA amino-terminal region has also been evaluated via NMR |CITS: [17420252]|.

The crystal structure of DnaA's DNA-binding domain complexed with an example DnaA box has been resolved to 2.1 &Aring; resolution |CITS: [12682358]|.

An experimental molecular weight of 48 kD has also been reported for DnaA |CITS: [6258023]|.

The ectopic expression of a mutant of DnaA (L366K) restores the cellular growth that is caused by the accumulation of the unprocessed outer membrane |FRAME: CPLX0-8279| Lpp (pro-Lpp) |CITS: [34163454]|. This growth restoration appears to be a consequence of the repression of pro-Lpp expression by the |FRAME:RNA0-386 |  |CITS: [34163454]|.

ECK120012029	PutA	6	asymmetric	PutA		ECK12	PutA is a flavoprotein with mutually exclusive functions as a transcriptional repressor and membrane-associated enzyme.  The switch between the two activities is due to conformational changes triggered by the redox state of FAD.  In the presence of proline, PutA is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and acts a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both reactions of the |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| pathway: the oxidation of proline by proline dehydrogenase and subsequent oxidation to glutamate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase.  The kinetics of the coupled reaction is best described by substrate channeling.  In the absence of proline, PutA is cytoplasmic and functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <i>put</i> regulon.    The N-terminal 47 residues with a ribbon-helix-helix fold contain the dimerization domain and the specific DNA-binding activity of PutA |CITS: [15155740][18586269][22013066]|.  The Lys9 residue is essential for recognition of <i>put</i> promoter DNA |CITS: [17001030]|.  Crystal structures of this domain have been solved |CITS: [17001030][18586269]|.  In the absence of proline, PutA binds to operator sequences in the <i>putA</i>-<i>putP</i> intergenic region and represses transcription, most likely by keeping RNA polymerase from binding to the <i>putA</i> promoter |CITS: [18586269]|.  The membrane-associated form of PutA does not bind <i>put</i> promoter DNA; thus, the enzymatic and DNA-binding activities of PutA are mutually exclusive |CITS: [15476410]|.  Based on Genomic SELEX screening it was suggested that PutA binds only one region in the genome located in the intergenic region of the bidirectional genes <i>putA</i> and <i>putP</i>; therefore, this protein was classified as a single-target transcription factor  |CITS: [34220787]|.  The proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) activity resides in the amino-terminal domain following the DNA-binding domain; a truncated protein containing residues 1-669 retains proline dehydrogenase and DNA-binding activity, but lacks membrane association and &Delta;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity |CITS: [12009917]|.  Proline dehydrogenase activity requires the presence of an electron acceptor.  The reaction is split into a reductive half reaction (reduction of the FAD cofactor by oxidation of proline) and an oxidative half reaction (reoxidation of reduced |FRAME: FADH2| by transfer of electrons to the quinone pool in the cytoplasmic membrane) |CITS: [6305659]|.  The proline:ubiquinone oxidoreductase reaction proceeds via a rapid equilibrium ping-pong mechanism with proline and ubiquinone binding at two distinct sites |CITS: [22040654]|.  Stopped-flow kinetic analysis of both half reactions indicate that reoxidation of the flavin cofactor is rate-limiting |CITS: [22148640]|.  The conserved H487 residue is critical for reversibility of the PRODH reaction as well as the kinetics of the conformational change and functional switching to the transcription factor activity |CITS: [28558236]|.  Association of the enzyme with the membrane is dependent on reduction of the FAD cofactor, which induces a change in the conformation of the protein |CITS: [3540963][8473341][12731889]|.  Both proline binding and FAD reduction contribute to the conformational change |CITS: [16156643][17209558]|.  The &beta;3-&alpha;3 loop of the proline dehydrogenase (&beta;-&alpha;)<sub>8</sub> barrel may transmit the proline-mediated allosteric signal that affects membrane association of PutA |CITS: [23713611]|.  A conserved C-terminal motif comprising residues 1300-1320 together with the &alpha; domain (residues 142-259) appears to form the membrane-binding domain of PutA |CITS: [29090935]|.  Crystal structures of the amino-terminal proline dehydrogenase domain have been reported |CITS: [12514740][15449943][17209558][19140736][19994913]|, and site-directed mutants in various active site residues have been characterized |CITS: [15449943][15450175][17209558][19140736]|.  These studies resulted in a detailed picture of the mechanism of the redox-dependent structural changes of the protein and identified Y540 as an important substrate specificity determinant.  A model of the entire protein including small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data shows that PutA is a symmetric V-shaped dimer.  Parts of the C-terminal domain may function as a lid that covers the internal substrate-channeling cavity |CITS: [22013066]|.  The C-terminal domain shows similarity to aldehyde dehydrogenases, indicating that the true substrate for the second enzymatic activity may be &gamma;-glutamamate semialdehyde, which is thought to spontaneously equilibrate with &Delta;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) |CITS: [7966312]|.  Steady-state and transient kinetic data for the individual dehydrogenase reactions as well as the coupled PRODH-&Delta;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) reaction have been obtained.  The P5CDH reaction data was fitted to an ordered ternary reaction mechanism |CITS: [24352662]|.  For the coupled PRODH-P5CDH reaction, the substrate channeling step is rate limiting; in addition, it shows a ~20-fold slower k<sub>cat</sub> when measured during single-turnover compared to steady state, suggesting activation of the channeling step |CITS: [24352662]|.  Expression of <i>putA</i> is reduced by prolonged exposure to osmotic stress |CITS: [2684374]|.  A <i>putA</i> mutant is more sensitive to oxidative stress than wild type.  Proline metabolism produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which induces the OxyR regulon, and thereby <i>katG</i> expression |CITS: [25384482]|. <i>putA</i>, among other genes involved in carbon source transport and metabolism, was downregulated in two MG1655 lysogens carrying closely related Stx2a phages O104 and PA8 |CITS: 31208335|.

In the absence of proline, PutA binds to operator sequences in the <i>putA</i>-<i>putP</i> intergenic region and represses transcription, most likely by keeping RNA polymerase from binding to the <i>putA</i> promoter <a title="18586269" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zhou Y,2008</a>.

Based on Genomic SELEX screening it was suggested that PutA binds only one region in the genome located in the intergenic region of the bidirectional genes <i>putA</i> and <i>putP</i>; therefore, this protein was classified as a single-target transcription factor  <a title="34220787" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Shimada T,2021</a>.

The proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) activity resides in the amino-terminal domain following the DNA-binding domain; a truncated protein containing residues 1-669 retains proline dehydrogenase and DNA-binding activity, but lacks membrane association and &Delta;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity <a title="12009917" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Vinod MP, Bellur P, Becker DF,2002</a>.  Proline dehydrogenase activity requires the presence of an electron acceptor.  The reaction is split into a reductive half reaction (reduction of the FAD cofactor by oxidation of proline) and an oxidative half reaction (reoxidation of reduced |FRAME: FADH2| by transfer of electrons to the quinone pool in the cytoplasmic membrane) <a title="6305659" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Abrahamson JL, Baker LG, Stephenson JT, Wood JM,1983</a>.

Stopped-flow kinetic analysis of both half reactions indicate that reoxidation of the flavin cofactor is rate-limiting <a title="22148640" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Moxley MA, Becker DF,2012</a>.

In addition, the genes regulated are induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown in the presence of the inducer, D-gluconate, and in the absence of glucose. In the absence of inducer, this repressor binds in tandem to inverted repeat sequences that consist of 20-nucleotide-long DNA target sites <a title="11115104" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rodionov DA,2000</a>. Binding of GntR to DNA is diminished in the presence of the inducer D-gluconate.

GntR is closely homologous to IdnR (53% identity) and belongs to the LacI/GalR family of transcriptional regulators <a title="11115104, 8655507, 9135111" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rodionov DA,2000.

The TrpR regulon is involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, transport, and regulation. This regulon partially overlaps with the TyrR regulon, since expression of several genes is regulated by TrpR and TyrR, the transcriptional regulator of the TyrR regulon |CITS:[7961453][1904443][2061290]|.

A novel regulatory role for the MalT regulon in glycolysis-associated utilization of carbon sources has been identified |CITS: [21912786]|.   MalT is monomeric in solution, but in the presence of maltodextrin and ATP it forms multiple complexes (oligomers) in its target promoters and activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of promoters |CITS: [1544897][1918057]|. The binding targets of MalT consist of 10-nucleotide-long direct repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS: [1918057]|.

This transcriptional activator |CITS: [3015733]| belongs to the LuxR family of activators. MalT subunits consist of four domains: the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, the N-terminal ATP-binding domain, and two domains (DT2 and DT3) involved in effector recognition (maltotriose) |CITS: [15733913][11209048][11709169][8227007][12003949]|.

ECK120012316	AraC	17	inverted-repeat	AraC/XylS		ECK12	The "<b>ara</b>binose regulator," AraC, is a transcription factor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in arabinose catabolism and transport. It coregulates with another transcriptional regulator, CRP; both are transcription factors involved in l-arabinose degradation. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of five operons related to transport, catabolism, and autoregulation of l-arabinose. Transcription of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, l-arabinose, binds to the AraC regulator. In the absence of glucose, cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC |CITS:[9409145][1744033][6319708][1400237][9600836][2231717][6377308]|.  AraC binds to five target sites in the <i>araB</i>p region. AraC binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the presence of arabinose, and it is absolutely required for expression of <i>araB</i>p |CITS:[2237403][3279415][2962192][3520549][8428590]|. AraC binding to the distal site (-123.5) has been shown to down-regulate expression of <i>araB</i>p and <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[1560456][3279415]|.   In the absence of arabinose, AraC is unable to activate <i>araB</i>p, but it regulates its own expression by repressing <i>araC</i>p and <i>araB</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[2237403][3279415][3520549]|. Arabinose triggers AraC-dependent activation of <i>araB</i>p and relieves AraC-dependent repression of <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[3279415][3520549]|. The <i>araBAD</i> operon is located upstream of <i>araC</i> and in the opposite direction.  In the presence of arabinose, this regulator activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoters, and the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5. The binding targets for AraC consist of 17-nucleotide-long direct repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[9409145][8980677]|.   Studies by A. Tischer et al. suggest that when arabinose binds AraC, a helix-capping motif is formed at the dimerization domain in a region close to the interdomain linker |CITS: [31199144]|. This capping motif appears to induce destabilization  of the amide hydrogen-bonded structure of two residues in the linker, which could allow  the optimum quaternary rearrangement of the DNA-binding domain that leads to an inducing state of AraC |CITS: [31199144]|.  The AraC regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer. It is composed of two domains. The solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain has been solved. It consists of two helix-turn-helix regions connected by an &alpha;-helix |CITS:[19422057]|. The N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and L-arabinose binding |CITS:[9409145][8451183]|. A new domain, between the dimerization domain and DNA-binding domains of the dimeric AraC protein, facilitates repression of the <i>araBAD</i> operon by AraC in the absence of arabinose |CITS:[22383259]|. Its crystal structure |CITS:[9367758][9103202]| reveals that the sugar molecule is bound within a &beta;-barrel, buried by the N-terminal arm of the protein. It has been suggested that this N-terminal arm plays a key role in the regulation of the arabinose-dependent DNA-binding properties of the protein. In the absence of arabinose it interacts with the DNA-binding domain and constrains this domain, and it releases it in the presence of arabinose |CITS:[9103202][18561170]|. This interaction appears to be affected by a mutation in the interdomain linker |CITS: [21840981]|. On the other hand, the function of AraC is largely unaffected by several other mutations in the interdomain linker |CITS:[26800223]|.

ECK120012347	MelR	18	asymmetric	AraC/XylS		ECK12	MelR, "<b>mel</b>ibiose <b>r</b>egulator," is a transcription factor involved in disaccharide melibiose degradation.  It coregulates with CRP, a global transcriptional regulator |CITS:[11742992][10760178][2851497]|. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of the operon involved in transport and catabolism of melibiose. Synthesis of this operon is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown on melibiose in the absence of glucose. Gene induction occurs when the physiological inducer, melibiose, binds to the MelR regulator and when cellular cyclic AMP levels are high.  In the presence of melibiose, MelR binds in tandem to repeat sequences in the <i>melR</i>/<i>melAB</i> intergenic region to activate transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the promoter <i>melA</i>p. The binding targets for MelR consist of 18-nucleotide-long repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[10760178][11742992][10747919]|.   MelR binds to five target sites in the <i>melA</i>p region. MelR binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the presence of melibiose, and it is absolutely required for expression of <i>melA</i>p |CITS:[10760178]|. MelR binding to the distal site (-237.5) has been shown to down-regulate the expression of <i>melR</i>p and <i>melA</i>p |CITS:[16621812][10760179]|.   In the absence of melibiose, MelR is unable to activate <i>melA</i>p, but it regulates its own expression by repressing <i>melR</i>p and <i>melA</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[10760178][11752325][9409145]|. Melibiose triggers MelR-dependent activation of <i>melA</i>p and relieves MelR-dependent repression of <i>melR</i>p |CITS:[9409145][11752325]|. The <i>melAB</i> operon is located upstream of <i>melR</i> and in the opposite direction.  This regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family of activators and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer.

The repressor CytR and the activator CRP, two dimeric proteins, interact to form a complex repressor nucleoprotein in the intergenic region. When only CRP is bound to this promoter, it functions as an activator, and then, when CytR binds to DNA and to CRP, the activation is repressed because CytR masks an activating region of CRP that otherwise would contact the RNA polymerase to activate transcription  |CITS:[ 8736525][10766824][9086266][10320573][10766824][8764393][8816767]|.

At times CytR also repositions CRP to alternative DNA-binding sites that are not functional for activation |CITS:[ 8736525]|.   Gavigan et al. (1999) and Perini et al.

Between these two domains, CytR has a disordered sequence that provides the HTH motif with freedom of movement |CITS: [9155036][9466254]|, which would allow this protein to interact with octameric half DNA-binding sites that could be arranged as inverted or  direct repeats and with different lengths of spacer regions |CITS:[9466254][9155036]|.

ECK120012646	BirA	40		BirA		ECK12	BirA is a bifunctional protein that exhibits biotin ligase activity and also acts as the DNA binding transcriptional repressor of the biotin operon |CITS: [6129246]|.  The effector of BirA transcriptional repression activity, biotinyl-5'-adenylate (bio-5'-AMP), is also a substrate in the BirA-mediated biotinylation of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein monomer (apoBCCP), and this relationship results in repression of the biotin operon when the abundance of apoBCCP (and therefore the cellular demand for biotin) is reduced |CITS: [9750231]|.  The enzymatic functions include the synthesis of the enzyme-bound biotinyl-5'-adenylate (bio-5'-AMP), and the transfer of the biotin from the adenylate to a lysine residue of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) of the acetyl-CoA-carboxylase.  The transfer reaction results in the active form of acetyl-CoA-carboxylase.    Alternatively, as a regulator, the enzyme-bound to bio-5'-AMP represses transcription of the biotin biosynthetic operon by binding to the biotin operator sequence |CITS: [6129246][3275654][2667763][1409631][8611542][8527435]|.  BirA is observed to be predominantly monomeric in solution |CITS: [6129246][8373769][9485476]|, with some minor multimeric species observed |CITS: [6129246]|.  BirA binds as a dimer to its 40 bp DNA site, the biotin operator |CITS: [1659455]|.  An additional, low-affinity BirA DNA binding site has been identified |CITS: [9931500]|.  Initial models suggested that monomeric BirA-bio-5'-AMP shows cooperative binding to its DNA site |CITS: [8373769]|, whereas more recent studies indicate that dimerization occurs before DNA binding |CITS: [12527300]|.  BirA-BCCP binding may preclude dimerization and therefore DNA binding and repressor activity |CITS: [11714930]|.  Biotinyl-5'-adenylate (bio-5'-AMP, the physiological effector) |CITS: [10529178]| and biotin |CITS: [11353844][350835]| stimulate dimerization and DNA binding.  Crystal structures at 2.3 angstrom resolution |CITS: [1409631]| and of a BirA-biotin complex |CITS: [11353844]| are presented.  Crystallization has been described  |CITS: [2642476]|.  The implications of the structure with respect to the binding of biotin and ATP are discussed |CITS: [1409631]|.  ApoBirA, the BirA-bio-5'-AMP complex, and the BirA-biotin complex have distinct structural characteristics |CITS: [8527435][10497026]|.  DNA binding affects the structure of the C terminus as well as the structure of the N terminus |CITS: [10497026]|.  Disordered loop structures on the protein surface appear to be involved in binding to biotin, bio-5'-AMP, and/or DNA |CITS: [10497026]| and in protein dimerization |CITS: [11124029][11353844]|.  A model of binding and reaction progression is presented |CITS: [11847279]|.  The enzymatic reaction of bio-5'-AMP formation has been kinetically characterized  |CITS: [8003500]|, and the kinetics of biotinylation of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein monomer have been determined |CITS: [8631788]|.  The thermodynamics of association between BirA and biotin and between BirA and bio-5'-AMP have been characterized |CITS: [8611542][11847279]|, as have the thermodynamics of dimerization and DNA binding by BirA, the BirA-biotin complex, and the BirA-bio-5'-AMP complex |CITS: [12450391]|.  Substrate characteristics have been examined |CITS: [7764094][2113052][10211839][10981714][11042165][3040718][8554526]|. Superrepressor biotin binding and homodimerization properties were measured and showed that all variants exhibit biotin binding affinities similar to that measured for the BirA wild type. Altered dimerization results in changes in an electrostatic network that contribute to allosteric activation of BirA for dimerization  |CITS:[29355305]|, which occurs via coupled distant disorder-to-order transitions |CITS: [31899864]|. Combined structural and computational studies showed that BirA is part of an extensive residue network, and substitution of several network residues yields large perturbations to allostery |CITS:[31899864]|.  Deletion of the N-terminal DNA binding domain eliminates DNA binding activity and reduces binding to biotin and bio-5'-AMP, but does not affect the production of bio-5'-AMP or the BCCP biotinylation activity |CITS: [8639659]|.  The DNA binding region is distinct from the regions in which mutations lead to heat sensitivity |CITS: [3536662]|.  G115S, R118G, and R119W mutations cause defects in binding to biotin and bio-5'-AMP |CITS: [10975574]|.  Mutations in the region that binds bio-5'-AMP also cause defects in dimerization and DNA binding |CITS: [11124029]|.

ECK120012762	LacI	21	inverted-repeat	GalR/LacI		ECK12	The <b>Lac</b>tose <b>i</b>nhibitor," LacI, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses transcription of the operon involved in transport and catabolism of lactose |CITS:[2166165][8568874][15950160]|. In the absence of allolactose, LacI represses the <i>lac</i> operon by preventing open promoter complex formation for transcription |CITS:[2166165] [21829165]|. In this repression system, LacI binds to two operators, and formation of the repressor loop is critical |CITS:[8984648][8984647][14725772][2166165]|. This repressor binds in tandem to inverted repeat sequences that are 21 nucleotides long and possess conserved motifs |CITS:[2166165][8984648][8984647]|.   LacI is negatively autoregulated when it binds to two DNA-binding sites, one located downstream of the <i>lacI</i> gene and the other one located in the coding sequence for the C terminus of LacI. The protein when bound to these sites forms a loop that inhibits the transcription elongation, thus producing truncated proteins that are tagged for degradation by the small peptide SsrA |CITS: [10899129][ 23658223]|.   Induction occurs when the physiological inducer, allolactose, binds to the <i>lac</i> repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator |CITS:[2166165][15950160]|. Nonphysiological analogs, such as &beta;-thiogalactosides, can function as inducers too |CITS: [28193904]|.  A single mutation, W220F, in the inducer-binding site of the LacI repressor reduces leakiness |CITS:[23807194]|.  The LacI protein belongs to the GalR/LacI family and as a member of this family of transcriptional regulators, LacI contains three domains: a helix-turn-helix motif located in the N terminus, the central domain that binds to LacI sugar ligands, and the C terminal, which comprises the tetramerization domain|CITS:[15950160]|.  The crystal structure of the LacI binding site for allosteric effectors has been resolved |CITS:[17543986]|. The importance of the N125 and D149 residues of the N terminal in the recognition of the sugar effector binding site has been determined |CITS:[17543986][21928765]|. A mutagenesis-based redesign of LacI enabled functionally compatible labeling with maleimide fluorophores. Three single-cysteine-mutated LacI proteins showed near-wild-type activity, and the cysteine residue at position 281 was retained and determined to be essential for LacI dimerization and DNA binding. It was found that the redesigned LacI retained robust activity in vitro and in vivo |CITS:[29856839]|.  Based on a computational rod model of the DNA-LacI complex, the looping of both linear DNA and supercoiled DNA minicircles over a broad range of DNA interoperator lengths was analyzed.  Analysis showed that the most stable loops for linear DNA occurred when LacI adopted the extended conformation |CITS:[21806940]|. Using the LacI transcription factor as a model, a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model was described |CITS:[29574055]|.  The importance of architecture for the DNA-binding protein in the DNA repression loop has been determined using high-resolution <i>in vivo</i> protein-mapping techniques with heterologous Nhp6A from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and the <i>E. coli</i> <i>lac</i> promoter  |CITS: [26039992]|. Based on molecular dynamics simulation, it was determined that the hinge-helix linker region (HH) of LacI is extremely flexible in solution, but a high concentration of salt can help kinetically trap the HH |CITS:[30485404]|. A computational analysis suggested that the hinge region of LacI is important for the nonspecific binding to DNA, for which electrostatic interactions among the LacI protein, DNA, and salt ions are crucial  |CITS:[ 27008630]|. The hinge region, which is extremely flexible in solution, is important for the transition from disorder to order when the dimer LacI repressor binds to the correct DNA sequence. The presence of the DNA binding domain proximal to the HH and salt make the ordered conformation more favorable even without DNA present |CITS:[31958546]|. Using a method adapted to high-resolution mapping of protein binding to DNA in living cells, binding of three different DNA loop sizes with the Nhp6A architectural protein was detected for a single sequence in the <i>lac</i> promoter |CITS: [26039992] |. On the other hand, in an <i>in vivo</i> single-molecule assay, the sliding process for the LacI TF was determined. LacI slides 45 +/- 10 bp on chromosomal DNA, and this can be obstructed by other DNA-bound proteins near the operator. LacI binds to the O1, O2, and O3 operators upstream of the <i>lacZ</i> promoter |CITS:[8638105]|. It slides over its natural lacO1 operator several times before binding (>90% repressor frequency), suggesting a trade-off between a rapid search on nonspecific sequences and fast binding at the specific sequence |CITS:[22723426]|. A 91-bp LacI-mediated, negatively supercoiled DNA loop mimics the DNA loop between the O1 and O3 operators in the <i>lacZ</i>p1 promoter |CITS: [26878689]|.  Working with a kinetic model of the lac circuit, it was determined that at least 27 protein molecules are produced no matter how much transcription and translation rates are reduced |CITS:[30447251]|.   The stability of DNA topological barriers generated by LacI is proportional to its DNA binding afinity |CITS:[26763930]|.  DNA supercoiling is capable of regulating the basal expression of the <i>lac</i> operon |CITS:[26763930]|. Negative supercoiling induces significant looping under any appreciable tension |CITS:[29365152]|.  The intracellular mobility and spatial distribution of LacI were studied by using photoactivated localization microscopy combined with single-particle tracking |CITS:[ 28402875]|. This combined method allowed investigators to determine the relative abundances of specific, near-specific, and nonspecific DNA-binding modes of LacI <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[ 28402875]|. In more recent studies of single-molecule tracking, LacI motion was compared between unperturbed cells and DNA-free cells; it was determined that LacI spends most of its search time bound to DNA |CITS: [33621478]|. On average, at any time 41% of LacI molecules are in long-lived DNA-bound complexes at target sites, 55% are transiently, nonspecifically DNA-bound, and only 4% are in free diffusion between DNA strands; a diffusion coefficient of 0.4 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>  was calculated |CITS: [33621478]|.  A potential RNA G-quadruplex structure, formed by guanine-rich sequences located in the coding sequence region of the gene, was identified  for <i>lacI</i> . This structure  could regulate the expression of the gene, as observed for <i>hemL</i> gene expression |CITS: [31964733]|.  A library of LacI mutants was analyzed by |CITS: [33784029]|.

ECK120012770	LexA	20	inverted-repeat	LexA		ECK12	LexA represses the transcription of  several genes involved in the cellular response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication |CITS:[2994755][10760155 ]| as well as its own synthesis |CITS:[ 6990417]|. This regulation is known as the SOS response |CITS:[2994755]|.   When DNA is damaged, the RecA coprotease binds to the single-stranded DNA in the damaged region to form a filament |CITS:[ 18497818 ][ 17364684]|. This filament interacts with the LexA dimer to activate its self-cleavage activity by an allosteric mechanism, causing the dissociation of LexA from its DNA targets and the induction of the SOS regulon for the repair of broken DNA |CITS:[ 18234215][1911941]|. RecF appears to facilitate RecA filament formation on the leading-strand single-stranded DNA gaps generated by replisome lesion skipping |CITS:[32513870]|. Phenylboronic compounds are able to inhibit the self-cleavage of the transcriptional repressor LexA, presumably through the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate |CITS:[31790690]|. The conformational flexibility of unbound LexA is the key element in establishing a coordinated SOS response |CITS:[21576225]|. A structurally dynamic peptide loop encoding residues 75-84 of LexA appears to be necessary for the recognition of RecA |CITS: [31999086]|.  In addition to the degradation of LexA in response to DNA damage, spontaneous self-cleavage activity of LexA has been observed under normal growth, triggering SOS response pulses |CITS: [34183814]|. This LexA cleavage appears to be partially |FRAME: EG10823-MONOMER| dependent |CITS: [34183814]|.  On the other hand, it has been observed that a LexA noncleavable mutant is able to induce the expression of the |FRAME: G6992| gene at late lag phase |CITS: [34181484]|. Therefore, it appears that in addition to the RecA-stimulated autocleavage of LexA, there is another mechanism that is able to induce genes repressed by LexA |CITS: [34181484]|.  LexA is widely distributed in bacteria, and it appears that it emerged from the  gram-positive group |CITS:[15528664]|.

IlvY binds cooperatively to two inverted repeat DNA-binding sites of 21 bp in the divergent regulatory region of the <i>ilvY</i> and <i>ilvC</i> genes for autorepression. When the inducer is bound to  the IlvY-DNA complex,  IlvY binding at the same DNA position activates  the transcription of <i>ilvC</i> by inducing a conformational  change in the structure of the complex that is correlated with the relief of a protein-induced bend in the DNA that  enhances the recruitment of RNA polymerase <a title="9556617, 3062177" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rhee KY,1998.

ECK120013014	AtoC	20		EBP		ECK12	AtoC, also known as antizyme protein (Az), is a protein that regulates processes at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels |CITS: [15200682]|. It inhibits posttranslationally ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) |CITS: [15200682]|, which is a key enzyme for biosynthesis of the polyamines which are essential components for cellular growth and proliferation |CITS: [3157043]|. On the other hand, in the presence of acetoacetate, AtoC regulates the transcription of the <i>atoDAEB</i> operon |CITS: [17616594][2883171]|, whose products are  involved in catabolism of short-chain fatty acids |CITS: [4563344]|. However, transcriptome analyses have shown that this protein not only regulates this operon but also upregulates or downregulates 11 and 32 genes, respectively, that are involved in flagellar synthesis |CITS: [12366850]|. On the other hand,  phenotypical analysis with an AtoS mutant showed reduced motility, sodium chloride sensitivity, and increased susceptibility to membrane-acting agents and an aminoglycoside antibiotic |CITS: [12897016]|. AtoSC is involved in the flagellar regulon, controlling the motility and chemotaxis responses |CITS: [22083893]|.   Through <i>atoDAEB</i> operon regulation, AtoC modules positively the biosynthesis and the intracellular distribution of poly-(<i>R</i>)-3-hydroxybutyrate (cPHB), a biopolymer with many physiological roles |CITS: [16564134]|. The products of the catabolism of short-chain fatty acids appear to be the substrates in the biosynthesis of this polymer |CITS:[16564134]|.

Cra carries out a glycolytic flux-dependent regulation. The glycolytic flux is determined by the concentration of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which is a molecule that was previously thought  to be a molecular effector of Cra |CITS: [23277571][27980674][8230205]|, but it has recently been shown by biochemical analysis that FBP neither binds nor regulates Cra DNA-binding activity |CITS: [29923648][30019355]|.  Cra forms a complex with DNA in the absence of fructose 1-phosphate, binding to an 18-bp-long sequence with an imperfect palindromic sequence |CITS: [9084760][16115199][8195118][8577250][8858581]|. In the presence of glucose it increases the intracellular concentration of the metabolites D-fructose 1-phosphate, which interact with Cra to prevent its binding or displacement of the target operons |CITS: [8230205][8577250][8550429]|. Cra is inactivated upon the interaction of the inducers. Cra has been observed to be predominantly a tetrameric structure in solution |CITS: [8195118]|.  Cra belongs to the GalR-LacI family of transcriptional regulators, which are helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins |CITS: [1805309][1639817][2198273]|. As a member of this family Cra contains two functional domains: an N-terminal domain which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding, and the effector binding domain located in the C terminus, which is homologous to the periplasmic sugar-binding protein for ribose, arabinose, and galactose.  It has been observed that a spontaneous cleavage of Cra at Asn-50 (N50) in old purified proteins or during the process of crystallization of the DNA-protein complex removes the N-terminal domain that by itself has less affinity to the DNA than the full-length Cra protein |CITS:[34666048]|. This spontaneous cleavage is increased in the presence of divalent metal ions |CITS:[34666048]|.     The deletion of the <i>cra</i> gene causes a reduction in cellular growth. This effect could be due to the inhibition of the osmoprotectant producing the genes, <i>betA</i>, <i>betB</i>, and <i>betT</i> |CITS: [21718532]|.  <i>E. coli</i> is able to acquire high hydrostatic pressure resistance when the activities of  CRP, Cra, and the glyoxylate shunt are decreased and the activities of RpoH and RpoS are increased |CITS: [32979485]|.  Based on wild-type and recombinant cells cultivated in two different substrates (lactose  and glycerol), the effect of phosphate-starved response (PSR) stimuli was investigated. Gene expression analysis showed that under PSR conditions, selected genes (<i>gapA, pykF, ppsA, icdA</i>) in the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (<i>zwf, gnd, talB, tktA</i>) were up-regulated, whereas other genes in lactose (<i>lacY, lacA</i>) and acetate (<i>ackA, pta</i>) metabolism pathways were down-regulated.

Cra carries out a glycolytic flux-dependent regulation. The glycolytic flux is determined by the concentration of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which is a molecule that was previously thought  to be a molecular effector of Cra <a title="23277571, 27980674, 8230205" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kochanowski K, Volkmer B, Gerosa L, Haverkorn van Rijsewijk BR, Schmidt A, Heinemann M,2013. Wei LN, Zhu LW, Tang YJ,2016.

Chavarría M, de Lorenzo V,2018</a>.

Cra forms a complex with DNA in the absence of fructose 1-phosphate, binding to an 18-bp-long sequence with an imperfect palindromic sequence <a title="9084760, 16115199, 8195118, 8577250, 8858581" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ramseier TM,1996. Shimada T,2005. Cortay JC,1994. Ramseier TM,1995. Negre D,1996</a>. In the presence of glucose it increases the intracellular concentration of the metabolites D-fructose 1-phosphate, which interact with Cra to prevent its binding or displacement of the target operons <a title="8230205, 8577250, 8550429" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ramseier TM,1993. Ramseier TM,1995. Bledig SA,1996</a>. Cra is inactivated upon the interaction of the inducers. Cra has been observed to be predominantly a tetrameric structure in solution <a title="8195118" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cortay JC,1994</a>.

Cra belongs to the GalR-LacI family of transcriptional regulators, which are helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins <a title="1805309, 1639817, 2198273" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Vartak NB, Reizer J, Reizer A, Gripp JT, Groisman EA, Wu LF, Tomich JM, Saier MH,1991. Weickert MJ, Adhya S,1992. Leclerc G,1990</a>. As a member of this family Cra contains two functional domains: an N-terminal domain which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding, and the effector binding domain located in the C terminus, which is homologous to the periplasmic sugar-binding protein for ribose, arabinose, and galactose.

It has been observed that a spontaneous cleavage of Cra at Asn-50 (N50) in old purified proteins or during the process of crystallization of the DNA-protein complex removes the N-terminal domain that by itself has less affinity to the DNA than the full-length Cra protein <a title="34666048" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Neetu N, Katiki M, Mahto JK, Sharma M, Narayanan A, Maity S, Tomar S, Ambatipudi K, Sharma AK, Yernool D, Kumar P,2021</a> This spontaneous cleavage is increased in the presence of divalent metal ions <a title="34666048" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Neetu N, Katiki M, Mahto JK, Sharma M, Narayanan A, Maity S, Tomar S, Ambatipudi K, Sharma AK, Yernool D, Kumar P,2021</a>  


The deletion of the <i>cra</i> gene causes a reduction in cellular growth. This effect could be due to the inhibition of the osmoprotectant producing the genes, <i>betA</i>, <i>betB</i>, and <i>betT</i> <a title="21718532" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Son YJ,2011</a>.

<i>E. coli</i> is able to acquire high hydrostatic pressure resistance when the activities of  CRP, Cra, and the glyoxylate shunt are decreased and the activities of RpoH and RpoS are increased <a title="32979485" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gayán E, Van den Bergh B, Michiels J, Michiels CW, Aertsen A,2020</a>.

Based on wild-type and recombinant cells cultivated in two different substrates (lactose  and glycerol), the effect of phosphate-starved response (PSR) stimuli was investigated. Gene expression analysis showed that under PSR conditions, selected genes (<i>gapA, pykF, ppsA, icdA</i>) in the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (<i>zwf, gnd, talB, tktA</i>) were up-regulated, whereas other genes in lactose (<i>lacY, lacA</i>) and acetate (<i>ackA, pta</i>) metabolism pathways were down-regulated. It was also demonstrated that Cra, CRP transcription factors, and the PhoBR two-component signal transduction system are involved in the regulation of central carbon metabolism <a title="33001250" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pandi K,2020</a>

ECK120013191	MarR	22		MarR		ECK12	MarR, "<b>M</b>ultiple <b>a</b>ntibiotic <b>r</b>esistance" |CITS: [8383113]|, participates in controlling several genes involved in resistance to antibiotics |CITS: [32561799]|, multidrug efflux |CITS: [20211899][19926649][17967850]|, oxidative stress |CITS: [10498949]|, organic solvents |CITS: [9324261]|, and heavy metals |CITS: [10498949]|. The antibiotic resistance associated with MarR appears to involve the acidification of the cytoplasm |CITS: [32561799]|.  MarR is part of the <i>marRAB</i> operon and negatively autoregulates its own expression |CITS: [9333027]|. The <i>marA</i> gene encodes a transcriptional activator that autoactivates expression of the <i>marRAB</i> operon and that regulates the expression of a global network of at least 80 chromosomal genes |CITS: [11395452][10852879][9333027][11473263]|.  Under laboratory conditions, the <i>marRAB</i> operon can be induced by tetracycline, chloramphenicol, or salicylate |CITS: [7768850][7504664][1715857][8521301][7777530]|, plumbagin, dinitrophenol, and menadione |CITS: [10419969]|, and other chemicals with phenolic rings |CITS: [10419969]|. All these compounds attenuate the ability of MarR homodimers to bind their cognate DNA sequences |CITS: [16450885]|. Cross talk between the <i>mar</i> and <i>rob</i> systems plays an important role in the response to salicylate |CITS: [22753060]|.   Based on the crystal structure, it was reported that there are two possible salicylate sites, SAL-A and SAL-B, in MarR |CITS: [11473263]|. However, these are not the physiological regulatory sites |CITS: [23687277]|. On the other hand, based on mutational analysis of the MarR homologue MTH313 from <i>Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum</i>, residues P57, R86, M74, and R77 were found important for DNA binding; residues R16, D26, and K44 significantly reduced binding to either salicylate or 2,4-dinitrophenol, and residue H19 impaired the binding to 2,4-dinitrophenol. These findings indicate, as with MTH313, the presence of a ligand-binding pocket located between the dimerization and DNA-binding domains |CITS: [23687277]|. For inactivation of MarR by salicylate, 2-4-dinitrophenol, or plumbagin, most of the residues important for ligand effectiveness lie in the &alpha;1 and &alpha;2 helices of MarR, between the putative DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain of MarR |CITS: [24111786]|.  2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate (DHB), anthranilate, and 4-hydroxybenzoate (in the absence of TolC), which are involved in enterobactin, tryptophan, and ubiquinone biosynthesis, respectively, can activate <i>marRAB</i> transcription. However, only DHB directly binds to MarR, affecting its activity |CITS: [20639340]|. More studies to determine whether DHB is the MarR effector under physiological conditions are needed |CITS: [20639340]|.  Sulfane sulfur is also sensed by MarR; in its presence the formation of a disulfide bond  between Cys-80 residues in MarR is induced, causing tetramerization of MarR, a form which has a decreased affinity to its DNA |CITS: [34829649]|.  Based on footprinting experiments and crystal structure analysis, MarR binds as a dimer to two direct repeat elements in the mar operator (<i>marO</i>) |CITS: [8636021][7777530][11473263][8383113]|. Each dimer subunit consists of six helical regions and a winged helix DNA-binding motif |CITS: [11473263]|, organized in such a way that the terminal parts of each monomer contribute to an extensive protein-protein interface in the dimer. Both direct repeat elements are required for full transcriptional repression, but either site alone permits partial repression |CITS: [15225313]|. N-terminal and central regions of MarR are responsible for the specific interactions with the two binding sites in <i>marO</i> |CITS: [9333027]|, and the C-terminal domain is also necessary for proper repressor function |CITS: [10858345][11751765]|. Biochemical and crystal structure analyses have demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal regions of MarR contribute to dimer formation |CITS: [11751765]|. Two conformational states generated by helix-loop-helix motifs of MarR [mediated by copper(II) oxidation of its Cys80] are important for its binding to and stabilization with DNA |CITS: [28124121]|.  The MarR regulator from <i>Escherichia coli</i> belongs to the MarR family, and it has two helix-turn-helix domains involved mainly in the development of antibiotic resistance |CITS: [14681377][10760140]|. The marR-type helix-turn-helix domain is well distributed among eubacteria and archaea, with at least 10 proteins from a variety of bacteria |CITS: [11473263]|. MarR plays an important role in the control of biological functions, including resistance to multiple antibiotics, organic solvents, household disinfectants, and oxidative stress agents. It also regulates synthesis of the virulence factor in pathogens of humans and plants, and it also responds to aromatic compounds |CITS: [11473263][10498949][10094687][12649270]|. The DNA-binding domains of MarR adopt a conserved winged helix (or winged helix-turn-helix) fold |CITS: [16450885]|.  Homologs of MarR are found in both bacterial and archaeal domains. The MarR family is one of nine families of transcription factors that evolved before divergence of these domains, over 3 billion years ago |CITS: [11523004][15556475]|.  The Mar locus in <i>Escherichia coli</i> consists of two divergently transcribed operons, <i>marC</i> and <i>marRAB</i>, which control an adaptation response to antibiotics and other environmental hazards |CITS: [9333027]|.  Organic solvent tolerance levels are greatly increased in double mutants of the <i>proV</i> and <i>marR</i> genes |CITS: [22257006]|. An increase of organic solvent tolerances (OSTs) was shown by using the <i>fadR</i> and <i>marR</i> double mutant of those two transcriptional regulators |CITS: [23053109]|.  <i>marR</i> shows differential codon adaptation, resulting in differential translation efficiency signatures, in thermophilic microbes.  It was therefore predicted to play a role in the heat shock response.  A <i>marR</i> deletion mutant was shown to be more sensitive than the wild type, specifically to heat shock, but not other stresses |CITS: [24580753]|.

Although little is known about the mechanism of regulation of the RbsR transcription factor, Mauzy et al. in 1992 demonstrated that this regulator acts as a repressor by binding to <i>cis</i>-acting elements, which have a conserved inverted repeat sequence and overlap the <i>rbsD</i> promoter <a title="1304369" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Mauzy CA,1992</a> 

RbsR belongs to the GalR/LacI family, which forms a bundle of four helices characteristic of proteins of an HTH DNA contact motif. The C-terminal 270 residues of RbsR are homologous to the ribose-binding protein RbsB

YiaJ regulates genes that are responsible for utilization of L-ascorbate |CITS: [30137486][31892694]|.Accordingly, YiaJ is involved in utilization control of other plant-derived nutrients, such as galacturonate from plant pectin, sorbitol (sugar alcohol) in many edible fruits, and fructose and its Maillard reaction product (fructose-lysine) in many vegetables. YiaJ also controls the expression of a number of genes for survival of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 under stressful conditions in nature. Based on these roles, it was proposed to rename YiaJ as PlaR (regulator of plant utilization) |CITS: [31892694]|.  When wild-type <i>E. coli</i> K-12 BW25113 and its <i>plaR</i> deletion mutant were grown in minimal M9 medium containing 0.2% galacturonate, which is a breakdown product of pectin, the rate of cell growth was higher for the <i>plaR</i> mutant than for the wild-type strain. On the other hand, in minimal M9 medium containing 0.2% each of sorbitol or fructose as a sole carbon source, overexpression of PlaR interfered with the cell growth |CITS: [31892694]|.

PlaR is negatively autoregulated, and it coordinately represses transcription of the divergent <i>yiaK-S</i> operon, related to degradation of l-lyxose |CITS:[10913096]|. Additionally, its operon is activated by insertion of IS<i>1</i> into the <i>yiaJ</i> gene |CITS:[9525947]|. Although little is known about the mechanism of regulation of the YiaJ regulator, recently it has been demonstrated to act as a repressor by binding to <i>cis</i>-acting elements that overlap <i>yiaK</i>p |CITS:[10913096]|.    YiaJ shows high homology to the IclR family of regulators; it is composed of two domains, an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a carboxy-terminal region featuring a second motif of unknown function |CITS:[9525947]|.  Compared to known global TFs, PlaR exhibits some interesting regulatory features. First, it has more intragenic binding peaks and fewer peaks located within putative regulatory regions. Second, it has fewer binding peaks than global TFs, such as CRP, Lrp, Fnr, and ArcA. Third, it binds to more genes with putative functions. Finally, its expression level is lower than that of the majority of global TFs |CITS: [30137486]|. The most common binding mode for YiaJ is downstream of the RNAP binding region |CITS: [30137486]|.

Compared to known global TFs, PlaR exhibits some interesting regulatory features. First, it has more intragenic binding peaks and fewer peaks located within putative regulatory regions. Second, it has fewer binding peaks than global TFs, such as CRP, Lrp, Fnr, and ArcA. Third, it binds to more genes with putative functions. Finally, its expression level is lower than that of the majority of global TFs <a title="30137486" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gao Y,2018</a>.

ECK120015681	LsrR	30	inverted-repeat	Sugar_binding domain		ECK12	Using particular analysis and high-throughput analysis (microarrays), it was established that LsrR regulates expression of many genes involved in several processes, such as autoinducer 2 uptake and processing |CITS: [15743955][17557827]|, biofilm architecture |CITS: [18309357][17557827]|, host invasion, stress responses, and foreign DNA, among others |CITS: [17557827]|.  It also regulates the expression of small riboregulators |CITS: [17557827]|.  LrsR pertains to the quorum-sensing system, which involves autoinducer-based bacterial cell-to-cell communication |CITS: [8288518]|.  It was demonstrated in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that LsrR directly senses and binds the molecule 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), phosphorylated |CITS: [17274596]| and dephosphorylated |CITS: [17557827]|. Distinct forms of DPD constitute the interconverting molecules family generally called autoinducer 2 (AI-2). The binding of DPD to LsrR inactivates LsrR, but phosphorylated DPD appears to specifically inactivate the action of LsrR on the expression of genes for autoinducer 2 uptake and processing (lsrACDBFG-tam operon) and lsrR itself |CITS: [17557827]|. On the other hand, it was suggested that dihydroxyacaetone phosphate inhibits binding of DPD to LsrR |CITS: [15601708]|.  The structure of the LsrR protein has been analyzed in crystallography and mutational analysis studies, where it was observed that it contains two main domains, the DNA-binding domain located in the N terminus and a ligand-binding domain around the C terminus |CITS: [23589368]|. This protein binds to DNA as a tetramer to regulate transcription; however, in the presence of phosphorylated autoinducer 2 (AI-2) or ADP-P, the tetramer dissociates into dimers, and the interaction of LsrR with DNA is greatly reduced |CITS: [23589368]|. The structure of LsrR as a tetramer was determined via exclusion chromatography and cross-linking assays |CITS: [23589368]|. The crystal structure of the LsrR protein complexed with the native signal (phosphor-Al-2, D5P) was determined |CITS:[24047255]|. D5P is converted into its hydrated form to create strong H-bonds with the carboxyl group of D243 |CITS:[24047255]|.  The lsrR gene is transcribed together with lsrK in an operon |CITS: [16321939]|, and this last gene encodes a protein that phosphorylates to DPD |CITS: [14622426]|.  The <i>lsrRK</i> operon is transcribed divergently from the <i>lsrACDBFG-tam</i> operon, and both operons are activated by CRP and repressed by LsrR |CITS: [16321939]|.

BaeR is the primary regulator of the ethanol stress response |CITS: [24999585]|. Leblanc et al. identified two flavonoids and also sodium tungstate as novel inducers to BaeSR |CITS: [21515766]|. These new inducers are natural substrates of the MdtABC efflux pump, and they lead to much stronger induction of the BaeST response in an <i>mdtA</i> efflux pump mutant, while indole does not |CITS: [21515766]|. As a consequence of this sensing, BaeS is autophosphorylated, followed by the transfer of the phosphate group to BaeR |CITS: [8282725]|, which is converted to an active form |CITS: [12107134]| that appears to recognize and bind a DNA sequence with a direct repeat symmetry |CITS: [17884222]|.

BaeR overproduction decreases the expression levels of outer membrane channel TolC, the global regulators MarA and Rob, as well as cephalosporin susceptibility in an <i>acrB</i> mutant strain, mainly by decreasing expression levels of outer membrane proteins (OmpC, OmpF, OmpW, OmpA, and OmpX) |CITS:[32882009]|.  Missense mutations in the <i>baeS</i> gene compensate  for a mutation in the genes encoding the major antibiotic efflux pumps AcrAB and AcrEF.

ECK120015994	AcrR	24	inverted-repeat	TetR/AcrR		ECK12	The "<b>acr</b>iflavine resistance <b>r</b>egulator," AcrR, regulates the expression of genes involved in multidrug transport and is classified in the nodulation-resistance division family |CITS: [8821940]|.  It also acts as a global repressor for the <i>mar-sox-rob</i> regulon |CITS: [25176444]|.  The crystal structure of AcrR shows that this protein is folded into nine &alpha;-helices distributed in two domains: the DNA-binding domain, which forms the typical helix-turn-helix in the N-terminal domain, and the ligand-binding domain, which forms a large internal cavity for multidrug binding in the C-terminal domain |CITS: [17950313]|. Mutational analyses have been used to identify the critical role of some amino acids for AcrR activity, such as Glu-67 |CITS: [17950313]| and Arg-45 |CITS: [16189130]|.  The activity of AcrR, which belongs to the TetR family, appears to be regulated by ligands such as rhodamine 6G, ethidium, and proflavin |CITS: [17644067]|. When one of these ligands binds to the C-terminal domain of AcrR, a conformational change in the N-terminal domain releases the regulator from its DNA-binding site. It has been suggested that the three AcrR ligands bind to distinct overlapping sites |CITS: [17950313]| and that two of them (ethidium and proflavin) can be simultaneously bound in the cavity |CITS: [17644067]|. This cavity has an inner surface with negative potential and the ligands are positively charged, thus favoring the binding between them |CITS: [17950313]|.  The <i>acrR</i> gene, whose expression is increased under general stress conditions |CITS: [8821940]|, is autoregulated and divergently transcribed from the <i>acrAB</i> operon. An inverted repeat sequence of 24 bp that overlaps the <i>acrAB</i> promoter has been identified as the AcrR-binding site |CITS: [17644067]|. This site is bound by two dimers of AcrR |CITS: [17950313][17644067]|.  Overproduction of AcrR improves organic solvent tolerance (OTS) through regulation of the SoxS regulon |CITS: [25176444]|.  Based on genome-wide analysis using microarrays, targets for AcrR have been identified that regulate the transcription of most genes encoding flagella/motility and increased flagellum formation.  AcrR modulates swimming motility but not swarming motility |CITS: [27558437]|.

Review: |CITS: [19130905]|	Local Regulator		TACATACATTtntgAATGTATGTA		The "<b>acr</b>iflavine resistance <b>r</b>egulator," AcrR, regulates the expression of genes involved in multidrug transport and is classified in the nodulation-resistance division family <a title="8821940" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ma D,1996</a>.  It also acts as a global repressor for the <i>mar-sox-rob</i> regulon <a title="25176444" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Lee JO,2014</a>.

The crystal structure of AcrR shows that this protein is folded into nine &alpha;-helices distributed in two domains: the DNA-binding domain, which forms the typical helix-turn-helix in the N-terminal domain, and the ligand-binding domain, which forms a large internal cavity for multidrug binding in the C-terminal domain <a title="17950313" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Li M, Gu R, Su CC, Routh MD, Harris KC, Jewell ES, McDermott G, Yu EW,2007</a>. Mutational analyses have been used to identify the critical role of some amino acids for AcrR activity, such as Glu-67 <a title="17950313" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Li M, Gu R, Su CC, Routh MD, Harris KC, Jewell ES, McDermott G, Yu EW,2007</a> and Arg-45 <a title="16189130" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Webber MA, Talukder A, Piddock LJ,2005</a>.

The activity of AcrR, which belongs to the TetR family, appears to be regulated by ligands such as rhodamine 6G, ethidium, and proflavin <a title="17644067" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Su CC,2007</a>. When one of these ligands binds to the C-terminal domain of AcrR, a conformational change in the N-terminal domain releases the regulator from its DNA-binding site. It has been suggested that the three AcrR ligands bind to distinct overlapping sites <a title="17950313" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Li M, Gu R, Su CC, Routh MD, Harris KC, Jewell ES, McDermott G, Yu EW,2007</a> and that two of them (ethidium and proflavin) can be simultaneously bound in the cavity <a title="17644067" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Su CC,2007</a>. This cavity has an inner surface with negative potential and the ligands are positively charged, thus favoring the binding between them <a title="17950313" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Li M, Gu R, Su CC, Routh MD, Harris KC, Jewell ES, McDermott G, Yu EW,2007</a>.

The <i>acrR</i> gene, whose expression is increased under general stress conditions <a title="8821940" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ma D,1996</a>, is autoregulated and divergently transcribed from the <i>acrAB</i> operon. An inverted repeat sequence of 24 bp that overlaps the <i>acrAB</i> promoter has been identified as the AcrR-binding site <a title="17644067" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Su CC,2007</a>. This site is bound by two dimers of AcrR <a title="17950313, 17644067" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Li M, Gu R, Su CC, Routh MD, Harris KC, Jewell ES, McDermott G, Yu EW,2007. Su CC,2007</a>.

Overproduction of AcrR improves organic solvent tolerance (OTS) through regulation of the SoxS regulon <a title="25176444" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Lee JO,2014</a>.

Based on genome-wide analysis using microarrays, targets for AcrR have been identified that regulate the transcription of most genes encoding flagella/motility and increased flagellum formation.  AcrR modulates swimming motility but not swarming motility <a title="27558437" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kim YJ,2016</a>.

ECK120026325	HipB	20	inverted-repeat	HTH_3		ECK12	HipB is a transcriptional repressor that functions as the antagonist of HipA, which was the first protein found to mediate the phenomenon of persistence in <i>E. coli</i>.  A small fraction of cells within a population are dormant persister cells; these cells are phenotypic variants that are not killed by antibiotics, leading to multidrug tolerance (MDT).  Persistence may be ultimately due to global remodeling of the persister cell's ribosomes |CITS: [25425348]|.  The HipAB system can be categorized as a type II toxin/antitoxin module.  In the absence of its binding partner HipB, HipA is toxic to the cell |CITS: [1715862][8021189][20616060]|.  Above a certain threshold, the level of HipA in the cell determines the typical duration of growth arrest.  The threshold level is determined by the level of HipB |CITS: [20616060]|.  The HipAB system appears to be regulated at the level of HipB stability.  Degradation of HipB is mainly dependent on the Lon protease, and is dependent on an unstructured 16 amino acid domain at the C terminus of the protein |CITS: [22720069]|.  A variety of crystal structures of HipB in complexes with DNA and HipA have been solved |CITS: [19150849][19622872][22999936][26222023]|.  Binding to HipB may lock HipA into a catalytically inactive conformation |CITS: [19150849]|.  The crystal structure of an extended promoter region that contained two operator sites revealed that the interaction with HipB dimers bound to both sites leads to dimerizarion of HipA, which blocks the active sites of both HipA molecules |CITS: [26222023]|.  The HipA-mediated phenotypic switch has been investigated at the single cell level |CITS: [15308767]|, and mathematical models have been developed |CITS: [18721814][22607777]|, suggesting that phenotypic variation in persister levels within a population can be due to different levels of noise in the regulation of the gene circuit |CITS: [22607777]|.  The bistability of the HipBA system has been successfully simulated with a stochastic model that includes reciprocal coupling of free HipA to the cellular growth rate |CITS: [24344277]|.  Above a certain threshold, the level of HipA in the cell determines the typical duration of growth arrest.  The threshold level is determined by the level of HipB |CITS: [20616060]|.  Expression of the <i>hipBA</i> operon is autoregulated.

A small fraction of cells within a population are dormant persister cells; these cells are phenotypic variants that are not killed by antibiotics, leading to multidrug tolerance (MDT).  Persistence may be ultimately due to global remodeling of the persister cell's ribosomes <a title="25425348" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cho J, Rogers J, Kearns M, Leslie M, Hartson SD, Wilson KS,2015</a>.  The HipAB system can be categorized as a type II toxin/antitoxin module.

The reaction is driven by ATP hydrolysis.  AlaRS belongs to the Class IIC aminoacyl tRNA synthetases |CITS: [2203971][1852601][23075299]|.  AlaRS was seen as a homotetramer in solution |CITS: [7005211]|.  Later experiments determined that AlaRS is homodimeric in solution |CITS: [21985608]| and can exist in an equilibrium between a homodimeric and a homodecameric state, depending on temperature |CITS: [8645007][9343380]|.  The enzyme contains one molecule of zinc per AlaS polypeptide |CITS: [1712632]|; zinc binds cooperatively and induces a conformational change in AlaRS |CITS: [8024549][10441391]|.  Zinc is important for tRNA recognition |CITS: [1549561]|.  Specificity determinants within tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> that are important for recognition by AlaRS have been identified |CITS: [3053691][8539617][8601277][10390340][10889033][11983895][12022232]|.

A mutation in <i>alaS</i> which compensates for a mutant tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> containing a G3-C70 base pair has been isolated |CITS: [2001352]|.  Discrimination of the G3-U70 base pair maps to a 76 amino acid region outside the catalytic center of AlaRS |CITS: [7742303]|.  The nucleotide at position 73 modulates the efficiency of the transfer step of aminoacylation |CITS: [1692733][1704363][10601268][10871402]|.  Specificity determinants and residues within AlaRS that are important for catalytic activity have been investigated |CITS: [2271589][9736622]|.  An N-terminal 461 amino acid fragment of the AlaS polypeptide was shown to complement a temperature-sensitive <i>alaS</i> allele <i>in vivo</i>; the C-terminal portion of the enzyme appears to be dispensable for catalytic activity, but is required for formation of the tetramer |CITS: [7005211][7025207][6358898][3882689]|.  Mutagenesis of an N-terminal domain peptide reveals residues that increase catalytic activity of the fragment |CITS: [3892692]|.  A central region of AlaRS is essential for interaction with alanine-specific tRNA |CITS: [2435005]|.  Site-directed mutagenesis has identified the Arg69 residue within motif 2 |CITS: [8163518][8060998]|, the Cys665 residue |CITS: [7918446]| and the Asp235 residue |CITS: [8172905]| as important for catalysis.  The Lys73 residue is important for recognition of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> |CITS: [2543446][8239663]|.  Single turnover kinetics experiments showed that a step prior to aminoacyl transfer is rate limiting |CITS: [16843487]|.  Kinetic parameters for binding of AlaRS to tmRNA have been determined |CITS: [10704215]|.  The central domain of AlaRS is the editing domain.  Many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been shown to have editing functions.  AlaRS misactivates glycine and serine, but has a pre-transfer editing function, hydrolyzing the non-cognate amino acid before transfer to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, and a post-transfer editing function that deacetylates mischarged tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> |CITS: [6117825][12949076]|.  A series of crystal structures, together with kinetic analysis and mutagenesis, has allowed elucidation of the basis for recognition of alanine by AlaRS and provides a structural and evolutionary explanation for the interaction with serine |CITS: [20010690]|.  The covalently continuous two-domain structure of the tRNA is required to enable editing |CITS: [12949076]|.  The editing domain alone is able to specifically recognize mischarged tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, utilizing the same discriminator base pair within the tRNA as the aminoacylation domain |CITS: [18172502]|.  It deacylates misacylated Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> with a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> of 6.6 x 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.  The site-directed mutants Q584H, I667E, and C666A have decreased editing activity; interestingly, the C666A mutation is 1.7-fold more active on Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> than on the mischarged Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> |CITS: [21241052]|.  A homologous free-standing protein with editing activity, AlaX, exists in other organisms; the protein family may have evolved from an ancestral form that was able to deacylate multiple tRNAs |CITS: [25724653]|.  |FRAME: CPLX0-3581| is able to edit Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> more efficiently than AlaRS |CITS: [28362257]|.  The C-terminal domain (C-Ala) plays a role in activating the catalytic sites of the N-terminal domain |CITS: [6200234]|.  C-Ala represents the major tRNA binding module of AlaRS |CITS: [19661429]|; this tRNA binding activity is required for efficient editing activity by the central editing domain |CITS: [18172502]|.  The C-Ala domain serves to bring the aminoacylation and editing domains of AlaRS together to bind to the acceptor stem of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> |CITS: [19661429]| and is important for dimerization of the enzyme |CITS: [26617997]|.  AlaRS represses transcription of the <i>alaS</i> gene by binding to a region flanking the transcription start site, and thus autoregulates its own expression.  The autoregulatory effect depends on the concentration of alanine, with higher concentrations leading to lower levels of <i>alaS</i> transcription.  At physiological levels of AlaRS, repression of <i>alaS</i> transcription is solely mediated by alanine levels |CITS: [6264314]|.  The designed <i>alaS</i> triple mutant T567F/S587W/C666F is unable to edit mischarged Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>.  When combined with a <i>dtd</i> deletion, the strain shows a synthetic growth defect and becomes sensitive to added glycine |CITS: [28362257]|.  The <i>alaS21</i> allele leads to increased resistance to novobiocin |CITS: [10217798]|.  Mutations in ribosomal proteins S5 and S20 partially suppress the temperature sensitive growth defect of an <i>alaS</i> mutation |CITS: [4280505]|.  The mechanism of suppression is thought to be a reduction in the rate of polypeptide synthesis |CITS: [796671]|.

The central domain of AlaRS is the editing domain.  Many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been shown to have editing functions.  AlaRS misactivates glycine and serine, but has a pre-transfer editing function, hydrolyzing the non-cognate amino acid before transfer to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, and a post-transfer editing function that deacetylates mischarged tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> <a title="6117825, 12949076" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Tsui WC, Fersht AR,1981.

AlaRS represses transcription of the <i>alaS</i> gene by binding to a region flanking the transcription start site, and thus autoregulates its own expression.  The autoregulatory effect depends on the concentration of alanine, with higher concentrations leading to lower levels of <i>alaS</i> transcription.  At physiological levels of AlaRS, repression of <i>alaS</i> transcription is solely mediated by alanine levels <a title="6264314" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Putney SD,1981</a>.

The designed <i>alaS</i> triple mutant T567F/S587W/C666F is unable to edit mischarged Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>.

The homeostasis of different metals in the cell is constantly monitored, and adequate pathways are activated or repressed to keep the metals within normal levels. Specifically, when nickel and cobalt exceed the normal levels, cell growth stops |CITS: [16956381]|.   Ni(II) and Co(II) binding results in the transcription of RcnAB <i>in vivo</i>, although it has been shown that RcnR binds a variety of metal ions <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19703465]|. Binding of Co(II) and Ni(II) to RcnR affects its flexibility at the N terminus, and this effect modulates its DNA-binding affinity |CITS:[ 29150441]|.   The <i>rcnR</i> gene is encoded divergently to the <i>rcnA</i> gene, which encodes an efflux protein that is involved in nickel and cobalt homeostasis |CITS: [15805538]|; it removes an excess of ions |CITS: [16956381]|. It has been proved by Koch and colleagues |CITS: [17120142]| that the <i>rcnR</i> gene is the target of Fur regulation in regard to iron levels (when iron increases, <i>rcnR</i> expression increases about 2.3-fold |CITS: [17120142]|).   An RcnR structure study showed that it has a charged N-terminal region (amino acids 1-34), followed by a highly conserved region of primarily nonpolar amino acids (35-64), that is, a region probably involved in binding metals. The N terminus determines metal-specific responses via recognition of cognate and noncognate metals |CITS: [22471551]|. Replacement of the Arg-14 and Lys-17 residues on RcnR affects its DNA-binding affinity |CITS:[ 29150441]|. Its secondary structure prediction shows three helices without any &beta;-sheet |CITS: [16956381]|.   Cognate metals bound to EcRcnR in six coordinate sites composed of (N/O)<sub>5</sub>S ligand donor atoms, while noncognate metals showed lower coordination numbers |CITS: [18505253]|.  RcnR is not similar to any other known transcriptional regulator; instead, it is homologous to other proteins whose genes are encoded next to genes encoding putative metal efflux proteins, metalloenzymes, or copper chaperones [and just a few (13%) of the homologs to cardiolipin synthases or membrane proteins] |CITS: [16956381]|. Such conserved localization with genes of metal-related functions suggests that these homologs are likely to play a regulatory role in metal homeostasis |CITS: [16956381]|.   RcnR acts as a transcriptional repressor for its divergent <i>rcnA</i> gene |CITS: [16956381]| and a weak repressor for its own expression |CITS: [19703465]|. In response to increasing concentrations of nickel or cobalt, RcnR releases the repression of <i>rcnA</i> and <i>rcnR</i> to allow its expression |CITS: [16956381][19703465]|. As <i>rcnR</i> expression is induced in response to iron even in the absence of Fur |CITS: [17120142]|, it is possible that RcnR responds to iron ions directly.   RcnR binds to two sites in the <i>rcnA-rcnR</i>  intergenic region with the sequence TACT-G(6)-N-AGTA |CITS: [19703465][16956381]|. The TACT inverted repeats are critical for specific binding. The G-tracts provide a structural component to facilitate binding of RcnR to DNA, because they endow A-form DNA characteristics to the RcnR operators. In addition, RcnR interacts nonspecifically with the approximately 50 bp flanking the core binding site, resulting in DNA wrapping and the introduction of a single negative supercoil into plasmid DNA |CITS: [19703465]|. RcnR forms a stable tetramer and binds as a tetramer to one operator. The tetrameric state is not perturbed by Ni(II) or Co(II) binding |CITS: [18505253]|.   Based on a computational model of apo-<i>Ec</i>RcnR in the tetrameric state, using experimental data it was determined that the model shows a large number of putative metal-binding residues localized at the interface between two monomers in the vicinity of Cys35 from one chain; the N-terminal amine and the imidazole rings of His3, His64, His67, and His60, known to be involved in metal binding, are all found in this region. In addition, Glu34 and Glu63 are also located in this potential metal-loading region, and their carboxylate groups could act as ligands for Co(II) and Ni(II) |CITS: [28517938]|.  Crystallization of RcnR-DNA complex with DNA that encompasses the DNA-binding site and X-ray diffraction data to 2.9 angstroms resolution were determined |CITS: [31929183]|. <b>X</b>-ray <b>a</b>bsorption <b>s</b>pectroscopy (XAS) analysis confirmed that both the Glu34 and Glu63 are ligands in the Co(II) complex, while for Ni(II), only Glu63 unambiguously acts as a ligand |CITS: [28517938]|. Cys35 appears to be a ligand for Co(II), but not for Ni(II), while His60 is not involved in Ni(II) binding and is only slightly involved in Co(II) binding |CITS: [31247878]|.  As nickel levels depend on the Nik uptake system (NikR regulator, NikABCDE transporter) and nickel is highly used during anaerobic growth by the Ni-Fe hydrogenase isozyme, the additional participation of RcnR and RcnA in nickel homeostasis changes the previous understanding of the cell's nickel processing. Iwig and colleagues |CITS: [16956381]| showed that RcnR is not directly related to other proteins that use nickel, although they showed that RcnA, as the exporter of excess ions, has direct participation. RcnA likely competes with NikR for nickel ions at low concentrations, and in such a way RcnA downregulates <i>nikABCDE</i> expression and nickel uptake (for this, <i>rcnA</i> must be expressed at a basal level prior to induction, as observed with higher nickel levels) |CITS: [16956381]|. Also, RcnA is important in the modulation of the hydrogenase assembly pathway through the NikR regulation that limits nickel delivery to the process, repressing <i>nikABCDE</i> transporter expression when intracellular nickel levels are high |CITS: [16956381]|.

The N terminus determines metal-specific responses via recognition of cognate and noncognate metals <a title="22471551" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Higgins KA, Chivers PT, Maroney MJ,2012</a>. Replacement of the Arg-14 and Lys-17 residues on RcnR affects its DNA-binding affinity <a title="29150441" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Huang HT, Bobst CE, Iwig JS, Chivers PT, Kaltashov IA, Maroney MJ,2018</a> Its secondary structure prediction shows three helices without any &beta;-sheet <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>. 

Cognate metals bound to EcRcnR in six coordinate sites composed of (N/O)<sub>5</sub>S ligand donor atoms, while noncognate metals showed lower coordination numbers <a title="18505253" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS, Leitch S, Herbst RW, Maroney MJ, Chivers PT,2008</a>.

RcnR is not similar to any other known transcriptional regulator; instead, it is homologous to other proteins whose genes are encoded next to genes encoding putative metal efflux proteins, metalloenzymes, or copper chaperones [and just a few (13%) of the homologs to cardiolipin synthases or membrane proteins] <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>. Such conserved localization with genes of metal-related functions suggests that these homologs are likely to play a regulatory role in metal homeostasis <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>. 

RcnR acts as a transcriptional repressor for its divergent <i>rcnA</i> gene <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a> and a weak repressor for its own expression <a title="19703465" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2009</a>. In response to increasing concentrations of nickel or cobalt, RcnR releases the repression of <i>rcnA</i> and <i>rcnR</i> to allow its expression <a title="16956381, 19703465" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006. Iwig JS,2009</a>. As <i>rcnR</i> expression is induced in response to iron even in the absence of Fur <a title="17120142" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Koch D,2007</a>, it is possible that RcnR responds to iron ions directly. 

RcnR binds to two sites in the <i>rcnA-rcnR</i>  intergenic region with the sequence TACT-G(6)-N-AGTA <a title="19703465, 16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2009. Iwig JS,2006</a>. The TACT inverted repeats are critical for specific binding. The G-tracts provide a structural component to facilitate binding of RcnR to DNA, because they endow A-form DNA characteristics to the RcnR operators. In addition, RcnR interacts nonspecifically with the approximately 50 bp flanking the core binding site, resulting in DNA wrapping and the introduction of a single negative supercoil into plasmid DNA <a title="19703465" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2009</a>. RcnR forms a stable tetramer and binds as a tetramer to one operator. The tetrameric state is not perturbed by Ni(II) or Co(II) binding <a title="18505253" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS, Leitch S, Herbst RW, Maroney MJ, Chivers PT,2008</a>. 

Based on a computational model of apo-<i>Ec</i>RcnR in the tetrameric state, using experimental data it was determined that the model shows a large number of putative metal-binding residues localized at the interface between two monomers in the vicinity of Cys35 from one chain; the N-terminal amine and the imidazole rings of His3, His64, His67, and His60, known to be involved in metal binding, are all found in this region. In addition, Glu34 and Glu63 are also located in this potential metal-loading region, and their carboxylate groups could act as ligands for Co(II) and Ni(II) <a title="28517938" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Carr CE, Musiani F, Huang HT, Chivers PT, Ciurli S, Maroney MJ,2017</a>.

Crystallization of RcnR-DNA complex with DNA that encompasses the DNA-binding site and X-ray diffraction data to 2.9 angstroms resolution were determined <a title="31929183" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Li C, Vavra JW, Carr CE, Huang HT, Maroney MJ, Wilmot CM,2020</a>. <b>X</b>-ray <b>a</b>bsorption <b>s</b>pectroscopy (XAS) analysis confirmed that both the Glu34 and Glu63 are ligands in the Co(II) complex, while for Ni(II), only Glu63 unambiguously acts as a ligand <a title="28517938" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Carr CE, Musiani F, Huang HT, Chivers PT, Ciurli S, Maroney MJ,2017</a>. Cys35 appears to be a ligand for Co(II), but not for Ni(II), while His60 is not involved in Ni(II) binding and is only slightly involved in Co(II) binding <a title="31247878" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Huang HT, Maroney MJ,2019</a>.

As nickel levels depend on the Nik uptake system (NikR regulator, NikABCDE transporter) and nickel is highly used during anaerobic growth by the Ni-Fe hydrogenase isozyme, the additional participation of RcnR and RcnA in nickel homeostasis changes the previous understanding of the cell's nickel processing. Iwig and colleagues <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a> showed that RcnR is not directly related to other proteins that use nickel, although they showed that RcnA, as the exporter of excess ions, has direct participation. RcnA likely competes with NikR for nickel ions at low concentrations, and in such a way RcnA downregulates <i>nikABCDE</i> expression and nickel uptake (for this, <i>rcnA</i> must be expressed at a basal level prior to induction, as observed with higher nickel levels) <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>. Also, RcnA is important in the modulation of the hydrogenase assembly pathway through the NikR regulation that limits nickel delivery to the process, repressing <i>nikABCDE</i> transporter expression when intracellular nickel levels are high <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>.

ECK120034476	DpiA	23	inverted-repeat	HTH_11		ECK12	CitB/DpiA is a dual transcriptional regulator involved in anaerobic citrate catabolism. In the presence of citrate and under anaerobic conditions it activates genes for citrate fermentation, the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon, the <i>citAB</i> operon, and <i>mdh</i>, as well as the <i>exuTR</i> operon for dissimilation of hexuronate |CITS:[18997424]|.   Due to the ability of CitB/DpiA to bind to A/T-rich sequences, multiple other roles have been assigned to CitB. When overexpressed in <i>E. coli</i>, it destabilizes plasmid inheritance, represses transcription of <i>appY</i>, encoding a regulator of anaerobic metabolism, and induces the SOS response by competing with DnaA and DnaB in binding to A/T-rich sequences at the replication origin |CITS: [9701802][14526013]|. Moreover, inactivation of penicillin-binding protein 3, FtsI, either chemically or genetically, induces SOS in <i>E. coli</i>. This induction requires <i>dpiBA</i> |CITS:[15308764]|.   CitB/DpiA belongs to the two-component system DpiB/DpiA, or CitBA. The operon containing both genes, <i>citB</i> (<i>dpiA</i>), encoding the response regulator, and <i>citA</i> (<i>dpiB</i>), encoding the sensor kinase, is transcribed divergently to the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon. CitA (DpiB) binds citrate with its periplasmic domain |CITS:[11889485]| and senses reduced conditions using a single Cys residue <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[19202292]|. The cytoplasmic domain is involved in autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to CitB (DpiA) |CITS:[19202292]|. Therefore, it has been suggested that the main role of DpiA/CitB is regulation of citrate fermentation |CITS:[11889485]|.

Dpi: <u>d</u>estabilizes <u>p</u>lasmid <u>i</u>nheritance 	Local Regulator	External-Two-component systems	tttttaattaatttaattaaaaa		CitB/DpiA is a dual transcriptional regulator involved in anaerobic citrate catabolism. In the presence of citrate and under anaerobic conditions it activates genes for citrate fermentation, the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon, the <i>citAB</i> operon, and <i>mdh</i>, as well as the <i>exuTR</i> operon for dissimilation of hexuronate <a title="18997424" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Yamamoto K,2008</a> 

Due to the ability of CitB/DpiA to bind to A/T-rich sequences, multiple other roles have been assigned to CitB. When overexpressed in <i>E. coli</i>, it destabilizes plasmid inheritance, represses transcription of <i>appY</i>, encoding a regulator of anaerobic metabolism, and induces the SOS response by competing with DnaA and DnaB in binding to A/T-rich sequences at the replication origin <a title="9701802, 14526013" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ingmer H,1998. Miller C, Ingmer H, Thomsen LE, Skarstad K, Cohen SN,2003</a>. Moreover, inactivation of penicillin-binding protein 3, FtsI, either chemically or genetically, induces SOS in <i>E. coli</i>. This induction requires <i>dpiBA</i> <a title="15308764" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Miller C,2004</a> 

CitB/DpiA belongs to the two-component system DpiB/DpiA, or CitBA. The operon containing both genes, <i>citB</i> (<i>dpiA</i>), encoding the response regulator, and <i>citA</i> (<i>dpiB</i>), encoding the sensor kinase, is transcribed divergently to the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon. CitA (DpiB) binds citrate with its periplasmic domain <a title="11889485" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kaspar S, Bott M,2002</a>and senses reduced conditions using a single Cys residue <i>in vitro</i> <a title="19202292" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Yamamoto K, Matsumoto F, Minagawa S, Oshima T, Fujita N, Ogasawara N, Ishihama A,2009</a> The cytoplasmic domain is involved in autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to CitB (DpiA) <a title="19202292" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Yamamoto K, Matsumoto F, Minagawa S, Oshima T, Fujita N, Ogasawara N, Ishihama A,2009</a> Therefore, it has been suggested that the main role of DpiA/CitB is regulation of citrate fermentation <a title="11889485" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kaspar S, Bott M,2002</a>

ECK120048934	RelB	12	inverted-repeat	RelB, RelE		ECK12	RelB is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator which belongs to the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family of transcription factors |CITS:[14659018][17924660][18501926]| and it is an antitoxin that prevents the lethal action of the toxin |CITS:[9767574]|. RelB is part of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon, which specifies a toxin-antitoxin system, and it is autoregulated by its own products, RelB and RelE |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135]|. On the other hand, <i>relE</i> encodes a cytotoxin that is lethal or inhibitory to host cells |CITS:[9767574]|, and it also encodes a cofactor that enhances the repressor activity of RelB |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135]|.  The <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon is induced upon entering nutritional starvation conditions, such as the stringent response or acid starvation |CITS:[11717402][11972253]|, while the level of RelB antitoxin is reduced as a result of Lon-dependent proteolysis. Consequently, RelE toxin is liberated, leading to cell growth arrest and eventually cell death |CITS:[12603745]|. The expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon under these conditions may have some as-yet-uncovered beneficial function |CITS:[9767574]|.  RelB and RelE form a high-affinity complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry when RelB is in excess |CITS:[18532983][19747491]|. This interaction of RelE with RelB is essential for regulating the expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon and for neutralizing the toxic activity of RelE |CITS:[11274135]|. The ReB<sub>2</sub>-RelE complex represses transcription of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon |CITS:[18501926]| via strong cooperative binding to the <i>relB</i> promoter region |CITS:[9767574][19747491]|. The 24-bp operator contains a hexad repeat (5'-[A/T]TGT[A/C]A-3') that is repeated twice on each strand |CITS:[18501926][19297318][19747491]|. The spacing between each half-site was found to be essential for cooperative interactions |CITS:[19747491]| between two RelB<sub>2</sub>-RelE heterotrimers. Only RelB makes contacts to the DNA and the RHH motif of RelB recognizes the four hexad repeats within the bipartite binding site. High affinity for DNA is only achieved in the presence of RelE |CITS:[18501926]|, which stabilizes the tetrameric form of RelB |CITS:[18501926]|.   When RelE is in excess, <i>relBE</i> transcription is stimulated |CITS:[18532983]|. It has been suggested, that excess RelE leads to the formation of a RelE<sub>2</sub>-RelB<sub>2</sub> complex that does not bind to the operator |CITS:[18532983][19747491]|.  RelB possesses a well-folded core domain at its N terminus followed by a flexible region at its C terminus, a pattern typical of other antitoxins |CITS:[18501926]|. The C terminus is responsible for dimerization of the dimeric core domain in the assembly of the RelB tetramer |CITS:[18501926]|, and the N terminus is responsible for binding to the <i>relB</i> promoter region via its RHH domain |CITS:[18532983][18501926]|.   By using a low-toxicity mutant of RelE, RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup>, the protein could be purified for structural studies. RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup> exhibits an &alpha;/&beta;-sandwich fold. Its C-terminal helix 4 lies next to a conserved positive charged cluster, the putative mRNA-binding site of RelE toxin. In a complex of RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup> with a C-terminal peptide of RelB (RelB<sub>c</sub>), this helix is displaced by helix 3 of RelB<sub>c</sub>, resulting in the neutralization of the positively charged cluster of RelE |CITS:[19297318]|.  The RelB-RelE complex in <i>Pyrococcus horikoshii</i> is heterotetrameric (RelB-RelE)<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[15768033]|, whereas in <i>E. coli</i> a RelB<sub>4</sub>-RelE<sub>4</sub> complex may form a tight association with two adjacent binding sites on the promoter, which could involve either DNA bending or DNA-induced protein conformational change |CITS:[18501926]|.  Several homologs have been identified on the chromosome of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 as well as on those of other organisms, such as <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, and in the <i>E. coli</i> plasmid P307 |CITS:[ 9767574]|. Bacterial <i>relBE</i> systems are conserved in archaea, such as in <i>Methanococcus jannaschii</i>, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, and <i>P. horikoshii</i> OT3 |CITS:[10633087]|. Alignment of the RelB homologs showed that these proteins are considerably more divergent than the RelE homologs |CITS:[9767574]|.  The sequence alignment of the RelB homologs shows that these proteins are considerably more divergent than the RelE homologs |CITS:[9767574]|.  Mutations in the <i>relB</i> gene confer a so-called delayed relaxed phenotype upon host cells |CITS:[5321960][326765][2990907]|, in which synthesis of stable RNA resumes approximately 10 min after the initiation of amino acid starvation |CITS:[9767574]|. These findings provided the first sign that the stringent response system might be connected to the MazEF and RelBE systems through the translation apparatus |CITS:[15809644]|.

This regulator forms a complex with DNA in the absence of nickel, binding to a 20-bp-long sequence with an imperfect palindromic sequence. YqjI is inactivated under conditions of elevated nickel levels, and the presence of this divalent metal prevents its binding to the target gene. Thus, this regulator maintains the iron homeostasis during high levels of nickel |CITS:[21097627]|. However, in vitro studies have shown that YqjI can be affected by other divalent metals.

ECK125135147	YefM	14	inverted-repeat	YefM, YoeB/Txe_like		ECK12	YefM is a transcriptional DNA-binding autorepressor for the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon. In addition, YefM also functions as an antitoxin to form a complex with YoeB, which is a toxin that is counteracted by YefM antitoxin |CITS:[17170003]|. YefM can bind alone with low affinity to the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operator, but together with YoeB it has an enhanced DNA-binding affinity compared to free YefM |CITS:[17170003]|. YoeB enhances the interaction with YefM by affecting the YefM conformation to one that is more favorable for DNA binding and/or by stabilizing the nucleoprotein complex at the operator site and reducing basal expression of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon |CITS:[17170003][19028895]|.  The <i>yefM</i> gene is upregulated during growth in biofilms |CITS:[14727089]| and <i>yefM-yoeB</i> is upregulated in persister cells |CITS:[16768798]|; it is probable that derepression of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> autoregulation occurs in these circumstances in response to an as-yet-unknown environmental or cell cycle signal(s) that interferes with the YefM-YoeB-operator interaction |CITS:[19028895]|.  The operator site 5' of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> comprises adjacent long (L) and short (S) palindromes with core 5'-TGTACA-3' motifs with a center-to-center distance of 12 bp |CITS:[17170003]|,  which was suggested to be  crucial for the correct stable positioning of YefM-YoeB at the two repeats |CITS:[19028895]|. The palindrome L covers the whole -10 box and the S palindrome surrounds the transcription start site; because of these placements, the YoeB-YefM complex specifically represses the transcription of the system by blocking RNA polymerase binding |CITS: [33260607]|.This sequence organization is common in <i>yefM-yoeB</i> regulatory regions in diverse genomes, suggesting that interaction of YefM-YoeB with these motifs is a conserved mechanism of operon autoregulation |CITS:[17170003]|.  The -35 region of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> promoter does not have the conserved motif of &sigma;<sup>70</sup> promoters, and this results in a low transcriptional activity relative to that of other toxin-antitoxin operons with the cognate motif (i.e., <i>axe-txe</i>) |CITS: [33260607]|.  The sequences of the core repressor binding sites of homologous toxin-antitoxin systems can be nearly identical; however, they can be differently positioned in relation to the main promoter elements, resulting in important differences in the level of transcription repression |CITS: [33260607]|.  YefM originally was described as a native unstructured protein |CITS:[14672926]|; later it was reevaluated as experimental, and modeling data have demonstrated that the protein is at least partially folded |CITS:[17170003][11735370]| and dimeric |CITS:[17170003]|.  The YefM antitoxin forms a heterotrimeric complex with the YoeB toxin (YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB) |CITS:[15980067][16109374]|. The tertiary structure of the YoeB toxin and the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB complex has been described |CITS:[16109374]|. In the complex, one C terminus in the YefM homodimer is unfolded and the other one shows an &alpha;-helical conformation and conceals the endoribonuclease fold of YoeB. Two N-terminal segments of YefM form a symmetrical dimer within the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB heterotrimeric complex and do not contact YoeB directly |CITS:[19028895]|.  YefM does not possess a canonical DNA-binding motif, but instead a pair of basic residues, R10 and R31, conserved in many YefM homologs are absolutely necessary for DNA binding by the YefM-YoeB complex |CITS:[12603745][19028895][ 16109374]|.	Local Regulator		TCATTGTACAATGA		YefM is a transcriptional DNA-binding autorepressor for the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon. In addition, YefM also functions as an antitoxin to form a complex with YoeB, which is a toxin that is counteracted by YefM antitoxin <a title="17170003" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2007</a> YefM can bind alone with low affinity to the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operator, but together with YoeB it has an enhanced DNA-binding affinity compared to free YefM <a title="17170003" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2007</a> YoeB enhances the interaction with YefM by affecting the YefM conformation to one that is more favorable for DNA binding and/or by stabilizing the nucleoprotein complex at the operator site and reducing basal expression of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon <a title="17170003, 19028895" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2007.

The <i>yefM</i> gene is upregulated during growth in biofilms <a title="14727089" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ren D,2004</a>and <i>yefM-yoeB</i> is upregulated in persister cells <a title="16768798" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Shah D, Zhang Z, Khodursky A, Kaldalu N, Kurg K, Lewis K,2006</a> it is probable that derepression of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> autoregulation occurs in these circumstances in response to an as-yet-unknown environmental or cell cycle signal(s) that interferes with the YefM-YoeB-operator interaction <a title="19028895" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bailey SE, Hayes F,2009</a>

The operator site 5' of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> comprises adjacent long (L) and short (S) palindromes with core 5'-TGTACA-3' motifs with a center-to-center distance of 12 bp <a title="17170003" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2007</a>  which was suggested to be  crucial for the correct stable positioning of YefM-YoeB at the two repeats <a title="19028895" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bailey SE, Hayes F,2009</a> The palindrome L covers the whole -10 box and the S palindrome surrounds the transcription start site; because of these placements, the YoeB-YefM complex specifically represses the transcription of the system by blocking RNA polymerase binding <a title="33260607" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2020</a>.This sequence organization is common in <i>yefM-yoeB</i> regulatory regions in diverse genomes, suggesting that interaction of YefM-YoeB with these motifs is a conserved mechanism of operon autoregulation <a title="17170003" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2007</a>

The -35 region of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> promoter does not have the conserved motif of &sigma;<sup>70</sup> promoters, and this results in a low transcriptional activity relative to that of other toxin-antitoxin operons with the cognate motif (i.e., <i>axe-txe</i>) <a title="33260607" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2020</a>.

The sequences of the core repressor binding sites of homologous toxin-antitoxin systems can be nearly identical; however, they can be differently positioned in relation to the main promoter elements, resulting in important differences in the level of transcription repression <a title="33260607" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kedzierska B,2020</a>.

ECK125141939	FliZ		inverted-repeat			ECK12	The transcriptional repressor FliZ controls the transcription of genes involved in the regulation of curli expression and the motility system |CITS: [18765794][22323519]|. During the post-exponential growth phase, this regulator is an abundant protein in the genome, with about 21,500 molecules per cell.  Transcriptome expression analysis showed a global antagonistic effect between FliZ and &sigma;<sup>S</sup> that  resulted in physiological traits, including flagellum-mediated motility and curli fimbria-mediated adhesion |CITS: [18765794][22323519]|. Overexpression of FliZ slightly increased polyP accumulation |CITS: [32341074]|. Moreover, FliZ interferes with binding within &sigma;<sup>S</sup>-dependent promoters, can also discriminate vegetative promoters, and can recognize alternative &sigma;<sup>S</sup> promoter-like sequences |CITS: [22323519]|.   The C-terminal domain of FliZ contains an &alpha;-helix that is similar to helix 3.0 of &sigma;<sup>S</sup>, and this structure promotes DNA binding |CITS: [22323519]|. In FliZ, this &alpha;-helix contains a positively charged amino acid (R108) that is involved in recognition of the extended -10 promoter. This promoter includes a -10 hexamer and different elements located at -14T/-13C, -12T, and -7T |CITS: [22323519]|.  Based on mutational analyses, it was shown that the upstream TC constitutes an extended  -10 motif and is recognized by R108 (which recognizes both  14T and 13C), a residue in the &alpha;-helix of FliZ. The DNA-binding N-terminal domains of recombinases and various phage integrases also have characteristics similar to the DNA-binding domain of this regulator.  FliZ is an inhibitor of curli expression by reducing the expression of MlrA, YdaM, and YciR.  FliZ interferes with the activity of &sigma;<sup>S</sup> during the post-exponential phase |CITS: [18765794]|.

Pesavento C,2012</a>. Overexpression of FliZ slightly increased polyP accumulation <a title="32341074" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gray MJ,2020</a>. Moreover, FliZ interferes with binding within &sigma;<sup>S</sup>-dependent promoters, can also discriminate vegetative promoters, and can recognize alternative &sigma;<sup>S</sup> promoter-like sequences <a title="22323519" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pesavento C,2012</a>. 

The C-terminal domain of FliZ contains an &alpha;-helix that is similar to helix 3.0 of &sigma;<sup>S</sup>, and this structure promotes DNA binding <a title="22323519" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pesavento C,2012</a>. In FliZ, this &alpha;-helix contains a positively charged amino acid (R108) that is involved in recognition of the extended -10 promoter. This promoter includes a -10 hexamer and different elements located at -14T/-13C, -12T, and -7T <a title="22323519" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pesavento C,2012</a>.  Based on mutational analyses, it was shown that the upstream TC constitutes an extended  -10 motif and is recognized by R108 (which recognizes both  14T and 13C), a residue in the &alpha;-helix of FliZ. The DNA-binding N-terminal domains of recombinases and various phage integrases also have characteristics similar to the DNA-binding domain of this regulator.

FliZ is an inhibitor of curli expression by reducing the expression of MlrA, YdaM, and YciR.  FliZ interferes with the activity of &sigma;<sup>S</sup> during the post-exponential phase <a title="18765794" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pesavento C,2008</a>.

Genomic SELEX analysis showed that RcdA can bind to the upstream regions of 27 genes. Among these predicted targets of RcdA, six genes correspond to transcription regulators (AppY, CsgD, FimB, RcdA, Sxy, and YcgF). This indicates that a large number of genes must be regulated indirectly by these regulators.

RcdA exhibits strong cooperative DNA binding and produces aggregates of RcdA-DNA complexes. In a specific way and with high binding affinity, this regulator recognizes and binds to sites that have closely related sequences. Furthermore, a consensus sequence has been proposed for RcdA sites. This consensus sequence shows a core binding site of 9 bp, TTGTgtACA, with inverted repeat symmetry |CITS:[23233451]|.

ECK125228870	UvrY			LuxR/UhpA		ECK12	The protein belongs to the LuxR/UhpA family.  This regulator participates in controlling several genes involved in the DNA repair system and carbon metabolism.    UvrY has been shown to be the cognate response regulator for the BarA sensor protein.  UvrY phosphorylated at the conserved Asp54 residue is the active form |CITS: [33318202]|.

ECK125257182	YhaJ		inverted-repeat			ECK12	YhaJ is a member of the LysR protein family. It was previously associated with regulation of virulence in an enterohemorrhagic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EHEC) strain |CITS: [26727373]|. Its capability to bind to the promoter regions of several genes in <i>E. coli</i> and regulate their activity has been demonstrated |CITS: [27713734]|.  YhaJ dosage varied drastically between four evolutionarily distinct <i>E. coli</i> strains, including enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> (EHEC), uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (UPEC), neonatal meningitis <i>E. coli</i> (NMEC), and the nonpathogenic commensal K-12, grown in minimal essential medium (MEM). In contrast, growth in rich medium (LB), which naturally enhances YhaJ expression levels, yielded almost identical expression levels of YhaJ in all strains |CITS: [32576674]|.  Increased YhaJ expression levels between minimal and rich media correlated with an increase in the number of global YhaJ binding sites |CITS: [32576674]|.  The regulatory network of YhaJ is surprisingly heterogenous despite its highly conserved nature across the <i>E. coli</i> phylogeny |CITS: [32576674]|. This suggests that strain-specific regulatory roles for YhaJ are potentially widespread in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [32298614]| |CITS: [31501343]|.  Highly significant conditional YhaJ binding in the regulatory region of the EHEC type 6 secretion system (T6SS) cluster was identified exclusively after culturing in LB |CITS: [32576674]|. The T6SS plays a role in EHEC virulence and macrophage survival, and this result highlights important flexibility in YhaJ for controlling several virulence factors in a single pathotype |CITS: [28288207]|. Interestingly, UPEC encodes a distinct T6SS, but no YhaJ binding was evident <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [32576674]|, suggesting pathotype-specific requirements for T6SS regulation |CITS: [27223818]|.

Its capability to bind to the promoter regions of several genes in <i>E. coli</i> and regulate their activity has been demonstrated <a title="27713734" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Palevsky N,2016</a>.

YhaJ dosage varied drastically between four evolutionarily distinct <i>E. coli</i> strains, including enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> (EHEC), uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (UPEC), neonatal meningitis <i>E. coli</i> (NMEC), and the nonpathogenic commensal K-12, grown in minimal essential medium (MEM). In contrast, growth in rich medium (LB), which naturally enhances YhaJ expression levels, yielded almost identical expression levels of YhaJ in all strains <a title="32576674" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Connolly JPR,2020</a>.

Increased YhaJ expression levels between minimal and rich media correlated with an increase in the number of global YhaJ binding sites <a title="32576674" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Connolly JPR,2020</a>.

The regulatory network of YhaJ is surprisingly heterogenous despite its highly conserved nature across the <i>E. coli</i> phylogeny <a title="32576674" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Connolly JPR,2020</a>. This suggests that strain-specific regulatory roles for YhaJ are potentially widespread in <i>E. coli</i> <a title="32298614" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">O'Boyle N, Turner NCA, Roe AJ, Connolly JPR,2020</a> <a title="31501343" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Connolly JPR, O'Boyle N, Turner NCA, Browning DF, Roe AJ,2019</a>.

Highly significant conditional YhaJ binding in the regulatory region of the EHEC type 6 secretion system (T6SS) cluster was identified exclusively after culturing in LB <a title="32576674" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Connolly JPR,2020</a>. The T6SS plays a role in EHEC virulence and macrophage survival, and this result highlights important flexibility in YhaJ for controlling several virulence factors in a single pathotype <a title="28288207" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wan B, Zhang Q, Ni J, Li S, Wen D, Li J, Xiao H, He P, Ou HY, Tao J, Teng Q, Lu J, Wu W, Yao YF,2017</a>. Interestingly, UPEC encodes a distinct T6SS, but no YhaJ binding was evident <i>in vivo</i> <a title="32576674" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Connolly JPR,2020</a>, suggesting pathotype-specific requirements for T6SS regulation <a title="27223818" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Journet L, Cascales E,2016</a>.

ECK125257183	IHF	13	inverted-repeat			ECK12	IHF, "<b>I</b>ntegration <b>h</b>ost <b>f</b>actor," is a global regulatory protein that helps to maintain DNA architecture. It binds and bends DNA at specific sites. IHF plays a role in DNA supercoiling and DNA duplex destabilization and affects processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and the expression of many genes |CITS:[15102446][1447969][11827473]|.  To regulate DNA replication, IHF binds to three loci in DNA, named oriC (origin of replication), datA (prevents untimely replication initiations), and DARS2 (promotes exchange of ADP/ATP in DnaA protein) |CITS: [34475859]|.   Before DNA replication initiation, IHF binds to the oriC region in a DnaA box R1-dependent manner, and it is rapidly released from this site after replication initiation to bind to other loci |CITS: [34475859]|. There are two specific binding sites for IHF in the oriC region |CITS: [34475859]|.  IHF is highly abundant in the cell. Its total intracellular concentration varies with growth rate and is higher in exponential phase, with 6,000 dimers per cell, than in stationary phase (3,000 dimers per cell) |CITS:[10515926]|.  IHF acts mostly as an accessory factor, stabilizing a correct nucleoprotein complex. For example, IHF was originally found to be required for the site-specific recombination of phage &lambda; with the chromosome |CITS:[6251971]|. For this, IHF stabilizes the bending of the DNA to facilitate binding of the bivalent integrase molecules |CITS:[2544029]|. There are two distinct DNA-bending steps during site recognition by IHF. The fast-phase step entails nonspecific DNA bending, while the slow phase involves specific DNA kinking during site recognition |CITS:[29267885]|. As another example, IHF stimulates transcription at &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters. Here, IHF acts to facilitate the formation of the loop between the upstream bound activator and the &sigma;<sup>54</sup> holoenzyme |CITS:[2208275][1404379]|.   Like HU, IHF plays a role in polyamine-dependent DNA condensation. The binding to low-affinity sites and introduction of sharp bends in chromosomal DNA promote the formation of rod-like condensed structures in chromosomal DNA |CITS:[19132923]|.   The intrinsic curvature and flexibility of binding sites of IHF were investigated. The preference of IHF for intrinsically curved and flexible DNA suggest a positive role in bending the DNA, since genomic regions with higher curvature and flexibility are generally easy to bend |CITS:[29625128]|. The binding sites for IHF have high intrinsic curvature compared with flanking regions, and these are characterized by high structural flexibility  |CITS:[ 29625128]|.  IHF is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, IhfA (HimA) and IhfB (HimD, Hip), that share about 25% amino acid identity |CITS:[3305480]|. The structure of IHF bound to DNA has been solved |CITS:[8980235][9032076]|. It binds tightly to DNA regions of about 40 bp carrying the 13-bp consensus sequence with A/T-rich elements upstream of the core consensus sequence |CITS:[2205834][2972385][8650000]|. IHF makes no contact with the major groove and only a few contacts with the minor groove |CITS:[2541927]|. Therefore, specificity is believed to be due to the sequence-dependent structural parameters of the DNA, where A/T-rich regions play an important role. The bend angle induced by IHF is approximately 160&deg; |CITS:[8980235]|.  Multiple conformations of bent DNA bound to IHF have been determined |CITS:[ 30336035][33418050][34352078]|. The three binding types of the DNA-IHF interaction form different angles of bending in DNA: associated, half-wrapped, and fully wrapped |CITS: [34352078]|. In the first one, both sides of DNA interact with the protein binding DNA without wrapping (angle of 66<sup>o</sup> bend); in the second one an arm of the DNA wraps the protein (115<sup>o</sup>); in the third one the two arms of the DNA wrap IHF (157<sup>o</sup>) |CITS: [34352078]|. It is worth mentioning that only with the DNA specific consensus sequence for IHF does the fully wrapped type occur |CITS: [34352078]|.  In addition, IHF appears to be able to bind to two DNA strands through a bridge using unspecific sequence |CITS: [34352078]|.  IHF is necessary for the induction of arginine- and lysine-dependent acid resistance (AR) via both transcriptional and translational controls of gene expression, as IHF activates expression of a specific set of genes involved in survival at extremely acidic pH |CITS:[24816374]|.  An increase in MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration changesthe way IHF binds to DNA, from bending to folding. This interaction is notaffectedby pH or temperature changes |CITS:[ 26657062]|.  A library of synthetic complex promoters was developed for the global regulators CRP and IHF; the promoters were formed by a weak 35/10 consensus sequence preceded by four combinatorial binding sites for these two TFs |CITS:[29091423]|. CRP and IHF have very different regulatory effects: <i>cis</i> elements for CRP preferentially activate promoters when located immediately upstream of the promoter consensus, while binding sites for IHF mainly function as UP elements and transcription is stimulated in several different architectures in the absence of this protein |CITS:[ 29091423]|. The extrapolation of these properties of complex synthetic promoters to naturally occurring regulatory systems could significantly impact the engineering of synthetic biological circuits in bacteria |CITS:[ 29091423]|.  A single-deletion mutants involving genes that encode IHF protein growing under anaerobic fermentation conditions caused decreased nucleotide synthesis, decreased glucose and ammonia uptake rates, and enhanced nitrogen transport and accumulation of amino acids and their precursors, as well as derepression of the aerobic TCA cycle and alternate carbon metabolic proteins |CITS:[33785570]|. The activities of some transcription factors appear to be enhanced (CysB, ArgR, PuuR) in fis gene mutants |CITS:[33785570]|. |CITS: [29748694]| et al. reported a relative increase in the glucose uptake rate above that required for the observed growth rate. In addition, higher ATP synthesis and redox balance rates were reported relative to the observed growth rate and biomass yield in the mutant |CITS: [29748694]|.  Based on proteomic studies, it was determined that the activities of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) such as  H-NS, HU, IHF, and FIS are also modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that signal differences in growth conditions; because none of the NAPs are known to bind any signaling ligands, these growth condition signals may be compensated for by these PTMs |CITS:[30287510]|.  Based on synthetic promoter variants harboring consensus cis-elements, it was demonstrated that both Fis and IHF can recognize the consensus binding site  of the other. However, changing this arrangement of the cis-elements can completely abolish the nonspecific binding of both. Combining cis-elements for both TFs could result in Fis and IHF repressed or activated promoters, depending on the final architecture of the promoters, in an unpredictable way |CITS:[32626694]|.  Under ampicillin treatment, the activity of IHF appears to increase |CITS: [33731833]|.

ECK125257184	HU	34	inverted-repeat			ECK12	The HU protein is a small DNA-binding protein that is considered a global regulatory protein and shares properties with histones, which play an important role in nucleoid organization |CITS: [10515926][10551881][10947847][19245936]| and regulation |CITS: [16258062][11254141][19194530][9218807][15289461][9192630]|.  The HU protein has been shown to be involved in DNA replication |CITS:[9171392][12366835][1879696]| and the formation of transcription foci |CITS:[20010798]|, and it modulates the binding of IHF to <i>oriC</i> |CITS:[1425583]| and stabilizes the DnaA oligomer bound to <i>oriC</i> |CITS:[18179598]|. As another example, HU is required for the expression of &sigma;<sup>S</sup> factors |CITS:[11251825]|. Recently, Oberto et al. showed that HU also plays an important role in the regulation of many genes in response to environmental changes and adaptation to stress, including changes in osmolarity, acid stress, SOS induction, and anaerobiosis |CITS:[19194530][19127382]|.  HU is a heterodimer formed by an &alpha;-subunit and a &beta;-subunit, which are encoded by the <i>hupA</i> and <i>hupB</i> genes, respectively |CITS:[3312963][3069589][6987059][2187099][2001682]|, and are differentially stimulated during cold shock |CITS:[11967080]|. HU is a transcriptional dual regulator. HU-1 (HupB) and HU-2 (HupA) are closely related but differ by 28 residues, and they have a high content of hydrophobic residues represented mostly by alanine. There is no sequence homology between the proteins HU-1 and HU-2 compared to any of the five histones of different eukaryotes studied |CITS:[6987059]|.   HU forms  high-affinity complexes with DNA containing sharp bends, kinks, branched and bulged structures, or single-strand breaks and loops |CITS:[8089835][7730334][8646783][9016640][8459763]|.  Three dimeric forms of HU exist in <i>Escherichia coli</i>: two homodimers, EcHU&alpha;<sub>2</sub>  and EcHU&beta;<sub>2</sub>, and a heterodimer, HU&alpha;&beta; |CITS:[12875839]|. All these forms are in thermal equilibrium between two dimeric conformations (N<sub>2</sub>&harr;I<sub>2</sub>) that vary in their secondary structure content |CITS:[20936276]|.  Based on NMR spectroscopy, it was revealed that the <i>hupA</i> and <i>hupB</i> genes code for the EcHU&alpha; and EcHU&beta; polypeptide chains, respectively (70% identity, 90% homology) |CITS: [25924603][34015918]|.  Based on high-temperature molecular dynamics simulation and NMR experiments, information has been obtained about the structural and dynamic features at the atomic level for the N<sub>2</sub>&harr;I<sub>2</sub> thermal transition of the EcHU&beta;<sub>2</sub> homodimer |CITS:[20936276]|. A 3D model has been proposed for the major I<sub>2</sub> conformation of EcHU&beta;<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[20936276]|.  It has been observed that the EcHU&beta;<sub>2</sub> conformation appears to be structurally more stable than that of EcHU&alpha;<sub>2</sub>|CITS: [34015918]|.  The crystal structure of the DNA-HU&alpha;&beta; complex has been resolved |CITS:[17360520]|. In the presence of poly(P), HupA is efficiently degraded by Lon |CITS:[17543195]|. The presence of HU depends on the phase of growth |CITS:[10515926]|, and it is distributed uniformly in the nucleoid |CITS:[10947847]|. Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature.  A <i>hupA</i> mutation affected the production of cell surface structures in strains lacking a <i>cysH</i> gene |CITS:[ 27091548]|.  When the N terminal is blocked with an artificial extension, the process of tetramerization of HupA and HupB is blocked, suggesting that this terminal is important in the process of heterodimerization, because the tetramerization appears to be essential to form heterodimers |CITS: [34015918]|.  Based on proteomic studies, it was determined that the activities of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) such as  H-NS, HU, IHF, and FIS are also modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that signal differences in growth conditions; because none of the NAPs is known to bind any signaling ligands, these growth condition signals may be compensated for by these PTMs |CITS:[30287510]|. DNA regulated by the NAPs (HU and Fis) directly or indirectly contributes to the symmetrical wave pattern of the base-pair substitution (BPS) rate |CITS:[31266871]|.  HU belongs to a family of DNA architectural proteins and acts mostly as a regulatory or accessory factor, stabilizing a correct nucleoprotein complex |CITS:[12372591][17259223][1925023]|. For example, HU introduces negative supercoiling in covalently closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I |CITS:[222478][1579448]|. Negative supercoiling induces significant looping under any appreciable tension |CITS:[29365152]|. On the other hand, HU binds preferentially to negatively supercoiled DNA than to relaxed DNA, and the tetrameric form is the predominant conformation of the protein on supercoiled DNA |CITS: [34827722]|.  HU remodels nucleoids during cell growth and environmental adaptation by promoting the formation of a condensed core surrounded by less-condensed isolated domains. It serves as a general microbial mechanism for transcriptional regulation to synchronize genetic responses during the cell cycle and to adapt to changing environments.  |CITS:[32518228]|.  The negative supercoiling of DNA in Fis, H-NS, and HU transcription factors modulates their 3D shape and determines their molecular dynamics |CITS:[28191853]|. The circular supercoiled DNA dynamically folds in particular higher-order structures (hyperplectonemes) |CITS:[28191853]|.  HU binds DNA without sequence specificity and with low affinity, but at low concentrations HU induces bends and at high concentrations HU induces the formation of rigid filaments |CITS: [10508175][2001682][10519118][10551881][18586040]|. The binding of this protein is destabilized when the tension of the double helix increases |CITS:[21427084]|, but the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> enhances the binding of HU to DNA with high tension and the protein enhances the stability of the double-stranded DNA under overstretching  |CITS: [34531428]|. In addition, Mg<sup>2+</sup> increases the mobility of HU on the DNA |CITS: [34531428]|.  Relationships between HU/IHF sequence, DNA-binding properties, and other protein features were identified based on sequence comparisons of thousands of known histone-like proteins from diverse bacterial phyla, in addition to a comparative modeling that demonstrated that HU protein 3D folding is even more conservative than the HU sequence |CITS:[29131864]|.  The effects of HU protein enhancements on DNA flexibility and the cyclization rate have been determined, based on a Monte Carlo approach, by Czapla et al. |CITS:[21459097]|.

When the N terminal is blocked with an artificial extension, the process of tetramerization of HupA and HupB is blocked, suggesting that this terminal is important in the process of heterodimerization, because the tetramerization appears to be essential to form heterodimers <a title="34015918" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Arora K, Thakur B, Mrigwani A, Guptasarma P,2021</a>.

Based on proteomic studies, it was determined that the activities of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) such as  H-NS, HU, IHF, and FIS are also modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that signal differences in growth conditions; because none of the NAPs is known to bind any signaling ligands, these growth condition signals may be compensated for by these PTMs <a title="30287510" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Dilweg IW, Dame RT,2018</a> DNA regulated by the NAPs (HU and Fis) directly or indirectly contributes to the symmetrical wave pattern of the base-pair substitution (BPS) rate <a title="31266871" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Niccum BA,2019</a>

HU remodels nucleoids during cell growth and environmental adaptation by promoting the formation of a condensed core surrounded by less-condensed isolated domains.

ECK125257202	RelB-RelE	12	inverted-repeat			ECK12	RelB is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator which belongs to the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family of transcription factors |CITS:[14659018][17924660][18501926]| and it is an antitoxin that prevents the lethal action of the toxin |CITS:[9767574]|. RelB is part of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon, which specifies a toxin-antitoxin system, and it is autoregulated by its own products, RelB and RelE |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135]|. On the other hand, <i>relE</i> encodes a cytotoxin that is lethal or inhibitory to host cells |CITS:[9767574]|, and it also encodes a cofactor that enhances the repressor activity of RelB |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135]|.  The <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon is induced upon entering nutritional starvation conditions, such as the stringent response or acid starvation |CITS:[11717402][11972253]|, while the level of RelB antitoxin is reduced as a result of Lon-dependent proteolysis. Consequently, RelE toxin is liberated, leading to cell growth arrest and eventually cell death |CITS:[12603745]|. The expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon under these conditions may have some as-yet-uncovered beneficial function |CITS:[9767574]|.  RelB and RelE form a high-affinity complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry when RelB is in excess |CITS:[18532983][19747491]|. This interaction of RelE with RelB is essential for regulating the expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon and for neutralizing the toxic activity of RelE |CITS:[11274135]|. The ReB<sub>2</sub>-RelE complex represses transcription of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon |CITS:[18501926]| via strong cooperative binding to the <i>relB</i> promoter region |CITS:[9767574][19747491]|. The 24-bp operator contains a hexad repeat (5'-[A/T]TGT[A/C]A-3') that is repeated twice on each strand |CITS:[18501926][19297318][19747491]|. The spacing between each half-site was found to be essential for cooperative interactions |CITS:[19747491]| between two RelB<sub>2</sub>-RelE heterotrimers. Only RelB makes contacts to the DNA and the RHH motif of RelB recognizes the four hexad repeats within the bipartite binding site. High affinity for DNA is only achieved in the presence of RelE |CITS:[18501926]|, which stabilizes the tetrameric form of RelB |CITS:[18501926]|.   When RelE is in excess, <i>relBE</i> transcription is stimulated |CITS:[18532983]|. It has been suggested, that excess RelE leads to the formation of a RelE<sub>2</sub>-RelB<sub>2</sub> complex that does not bind to the operator |CITS:[18532983][19747491]|.  RelB possesses a well-folded core domain at its N terminus followed by a flexible region at its C terminus, a pattern typical of other antitoxins |CITS:[18501926]|. The C terminus is responsible for dimerization of the dimeric core domain in the assembly of the RelB tetramer |CITS:[18501926]|, and the N terminus is responsible for binding to the <i>relB</i> promoter region via its RHH domain |CITS:[18532983][18501926]|.   By using a low-toxicity mutant of RelE, RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup>, the protein could be purified for structural studies. RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup> exhibits an &alpha;/&beta;-sandwich fold. Its C-terminal helix 4 lies next to a conserved positive charged cluster, the putative mRNA-binding site of RelE toxin. In a complex of RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup> with a C-terminal peptide of RelB (RelB<sub>c</sub>), this helix is displaced by helix 3 of RelB<sub>c</sub>, resulting in the neutralization of the positively charged cluster of RelE |CITS:[19297318]|.  The RelB-RelE complex in <i>Pyrococcus horikoshii</i> is heterotetrameric (RelB-RelE)<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[15768033]|, whereas in <i>E. coli</i> a RelB<sub>4</sub>-RelE<sub>4</sub> complex may form a tight association with two adjacent binding sites on the promoter, which could involve either DNA bending or DNA-induced protein conformational change |CITS:[18501926]|.  Several homologs have been identified on the chromosome of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 as well as on those of other organisms, such as <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, and in the <i>E. coli</i> plasmid P307 |CITS:[ 9767574]|. Bacterial <i>relBE</i> systems are conserved in archaea, such as in <i>Methanococcus jannaschii</i>, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, and <i>P. horikoshii</i> OT3 |CITS:[10633087]|. Alignment of the RelB homologs showed that these proteins are considerably more divergent than the RelE homologs |CITS:[9767574]|.  The sequence alignment of the RelB homologs shows that these proteins are considerably more divergent than the RelE homologs |CITS:[9767574]|.  Mutations in the <i>relB</i> gene confer a so-called delayed relaxed phenotype upon host cells |CITS:[5321960][326765][2990907]|, in which synthesis of stable RNA resumes approximately 10 min after the initiation of amino acid starvation |CITS:[9767574]|.

ECK125257203	YefM-YoeB	14	inverted-repeat			ECK12	YefM is a transcriptional DNA-binding autorepressor for the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon. In addition, YefM also functions as an antitoxin to form a complex with YoeB, which is a toxin that is counteracted by YefM antitoxin |CITS:[17170003]|. YefM can bind alone with low affinity to the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operator, but together with YoeB it has an enhanced DNA-binding affinity compared to free YefM |CITS:[17170003]|. YoeB enhances the interaction with YefM by affecting the YefM conformation to one that is more favorable for DNA binding and/or by stabilizing the nucleoprotein complex at the operator site and reducing basal expression of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon |CITS:[17170003][19028895]|.  The <i>yefM</i> gene is upregulated during growth in biofilms |CITS:[14727089]| and <i>yefM-yoeB</i> is upregulated in persister cells |CITS:[16768798]|; it is probable that derepression of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> autoregulation occurs in these circumstances in response to an as-yet-unknown environmental or cell cycle signal(s) that interferes with the YefM-YoeB-operator interaction |CITS:[19028895]|.  The operator site 5' of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> comprises adjacent long (L) and short (S) palindromes with core 5'-TGTACA-3' motifs with a center-to-center distance of 12 bp |CITS:[17170003]|,  which was suggested to be  crucial for the correct stable positioning of YefM-YoeB at the two repeats |CITS:[19028895]|. The palindrome L covers the whole -10 box and the S palindrome surrounds the transcription start site; because of these placements, the YoeB-YefM complex specifically represses the transcription of the system by blocking RNA polymerase binding |CITS: [33260607]|.This sequence organization is common in <i>yefM-yoeB</i> regulatory regions in diverse genomes, suggesting that interaction of YefM-YoeB with these motifs is a conserved mechanism of operon autoregulation |CITS:[17170003]|.  The -35 region of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> promoter does not have the conserved motif of &sigma;<sup>70</sup> promoters, and this results in a low transcriptional activity relative to that of other toxin-antitoxin operons with the cognate motif (i.e., <i>axe-txe</i>) |CITS: [33260607]|.  The sequences of the core repressor binding sites of homologous toxin-antitoxin systems can be nearly identical; however, they can be differently positioned in relation to the main promoter elements, resulting in important differences in the level of transcription repression |CITS: [33260607]|.  YefM originally was described as a native unstructured protein |CITS:[14672926]|; later it was reevaluated as experimental, and modeling data have demonstrated that the protein is at least partially folded |CITS:[17170003][11735370]| and dimeric |CITS:[17170003]|.  The YefM antitoxin forms a heterotrimeric complex with the YoeB toxin (YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB) |CITS:[15980067][16109374]|. The tertiary structure of the YoeB toxin and the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB complex has been described |CITS:[16109374]|. In the complex, one C terminus in the YefM homodimer is unfolded and the other one shows an &alpha;-helical conformation and conceals the endoribonuclease fold of YoeB. Two N-terminal segments of YefM form a symmetrical dimer within the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB heterotrimeric complex and do not contact YoeB directly |CITS:[19028895]|.  YefM does not possess a canonical DNA-binding motif, but instead a pair of basic residues, R10 and R31, conserved in many YefM homologs are absolutely necessary for DNA binding by the YefM-YoeB complex |CITS:[12603745][19028895][ 16109374]|.

Based on transcriptome analysis, expression levels of a set of genes regulated by Fur change substantially in response to antibiotic treatment  |CITS:[25063442]|. Iron homeostasis influences the evolution of ciprofloxacin resistance |CITS:[25063442]|.  FUR is a transcriptional repressor but also can be an activator; the positive regulation of this regulator  is mediated by the indirect effect of RhyB, which is an antisense small RNA |CITS:[17216355][12975324][16982641][16199566][11917098][14617150]|.  FUR is a sensor  of  the concentration of intracellular iron, and the genetic repression occurs when the physiological inducer, iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), binds to FUR. This cofactor is required for DNA binding |CITS:[16216078][17216355]|. FUR also is considered a  metalloregulatory protein and can sense different  divalent metal ions, such as Zn(II), Cu(II), Cd(II), Co(II), and Mn(II) |CITS:[3294800][10350474][17216355][11895294][16216078][16690618][19023664]|. Transcriptomic and statistical modeling analyses with Zn concentration shifts showed a transient change in the activity of the iron regulator Fur and of the oxidative stress regulator SoxS; these findings suggest a competitive binding mechanism for the physiology of Zn and Fe uptake |CITS:[22016571]|. On the other hand, D'Autreaux et al. showed that nitric oxide, a radical that is potentially toxic, inhibits  the DNA binding of this repressor |CITS:[16417522][12475930]|.  During iron starvation,  Fur is inactivated by the proteins YdiV and SlyD in a cooperative manner. They cause a conformational change in Fur that prevents its binding to DNA |CITS:[32813023]|.  In the presence of iron, FUR binds in tandem to possible inverted repeat sequences in the  intergenic region to repress transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the regulated promoter. The FUR-binding sites were previously represented as regions of 19 bp, which were determined by footprinting of several promoter sequences |CITS:[3294800][2644221][8107138][2015825]|. Different aligments and computational analysis of these sequences showed different overlapping 15-bp sequences: TGATAATnATTATCA, consisting of two inverted repeats of 7 bp separated by 1 bp |CITS:[12374814][17921503]|. Experimental support for this consensus sequence was obtained from footprinting, site-directed mutagenesis experiments, analysis of the affinity and stoichiometry of DNA binding, gel retardation assays, etc. |CITS:[12374814][12644489]|. Currently there are different interpretations and models to explain how FUR could overlap inverted repeats in tandem |CITS:[12374814][17921503][12644489][16443380]|.  Under anaerobic and iron-dependent growth conditions, Fur binds to more sites across the genome, increasing the number of target genes and its repressor effect. Four operons are regulated by Fur exclusively under these conditions |CITS:[ 26670385]|. Strains lacking Fur grow slower under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions |CITS:[ 26670385]| , which suggests that Fur is controlled by O<sub>2</sub>. O<sub>2</sub> has a direct effect on levels of active Fur <i>in vivo</i>, and several factors contribute to the expression profile of the Fur regulon in response to O<sub>2</sub>, such as upregulation of FeoABC Fe<sup>2+</sup> uptake under anaerobic conditions |CITS:[29087312]|. Based on work with mutants and a predicted model, it was determined that when the intracellular free iron content is elevated, Fur protein reversibly binds a [2Fe-2S] cluster  to sense intracellular iron homeostasis via conserved cysteine residues  (Cys-93, Cys-96, Cys-113) |CITS:[32928958]|.This fact raises the possibility that Fur can sense iron via [2Fe-2S] instead of via Fe<sup>2+</sup> |CITS: [33188081]|.

FUR is a transcriptional repressor but also can be an activator; the positive regulation of this regulator  is mediated by the indirect effect of RhyB, which is an antisense small RNA <a title="17216355, 12975324, 16982641, 16199566, 11917098, 14617150" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Lee JW, Helmann JD,2007.

FUR is a sensor  of  the concentration of intracellular iron, and the genetic repression occurs when the physiological inducer, iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), binds to FUR.

In the presence of iron, FUR binds in tandem to possible inverted repeat sequences in the  intergenic region to repress transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the regulated promoter. The FUR-binding sites were previously represented as regions of 19 bp, which were determined by footprinting of several promoter sequences <a title="3294800, 2644221, 8107138, 2015825" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">de Lorenzo V, Wee S, Herrero M, Neilands JB,1987.

ECK125288994	CueR	19	inverted-repeat			ECK12	The "<b>Cu</b> <b>e</b>fflux <b>r</b>egulator," CueR, regulates genes related to the primary copper homeostasis system |CITS: [15773991][11167016][11222619][10915804]|, which responds to the presence of copper, silver, or gold ions |CITS: [15773991][12832075][12446701]|. The Cue system is predominantly active under aerobic conditions |CITS: [11399769]|. Oxidative stress and Fe excess, provoked by Zn(II) stress, cause a dysregulation of CueR |CITS: [31586033]|.  The crystal structures of CueR dimers bound to Cu<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, or Au<sup>+</sup> have been solved |CITS: [12958362]|. Each monomer consists of three domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain carrying two helix-turn-helix motifs, a central dimerization domain, and a C-terminal metal-binding domain. The DNA-binding and dimerization domains are characteristic of the MerR family of proteins. The dimerization domain contains a 10-turn &alpha;-helix that forms an antiparallel coiled-coil with the helix of the other monomer. The metal-binding domain contains an unusual metal receptor site in which the bound metal is inaccessible to the solvent. The metal ion is bound with a linear coordination to two conserved cysteine residues. This dithiolate coordination confers the metal ion selectivity for +1 ions |CITS: [12958362]|. The sensitivity of CueR for copper(I) ions is extremely high (in the zeptomolar range), which corresponds to less than one atom per cell. Apparently it is the task of CueR and CopA to clear the toxic copper ions rapidly from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space |CITS: [12958362]|. It has been demonstrated that up to two Hg<sup>II</sup> ions bind with high affinity to WT CueR, one at the functional metal binding site (C112 and C120) and the other at the C-terminal CCHH motif. This motif provides a selection of ligands that could be participating in coordination of both soft and intermediate metal ions |CITS:[31365771]|.  The CueR residues S4,  K15, F19, Y20, N34, and Y36 appear to be essential to activate transcription |CITS:[32989300]|.  CueR activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of promoters and represses it by binding downstream of the transcription start site |CITS: [11136469]|. CueR  binds to a 19-bp sequence containing two 7-bp inverted repeats separated by a 7-bp spacer |CITS: [11136469]|.  Binding occurs <i>in vitro</i> in both the presence and the absence of copper ions. Holo-CueR binds more strongly to DNA than apo-CueR and with a higher conformational flexibility |CITS: [19651042]|. Both holo- and apo-CueR bend DNA |CITS: [19651042]|. The RNA polymerase is capable of binding to the <i>copA</i> promoter independently of the holo or apo conformation of CueR, generating two types of interactions between RNA polymerase and the <i>copA</i> promoter: one is favored by the holo-CueR conformation to activate transcription, and the other one is favored by apo-CueR to repress transcription |CITS:[26483469]|. Holo-CueR is able to change the structure of DNA around the promoter, allowing transcription initiation |CITS:[32989300]|.

The crystal structures of CueR dimers bound to Cu<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, or Au<sup>+</sup> have been solved <a title="12958362" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Changela A,2003</a>. Each monomer consists of three domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain carrying two helix-turn-helix motifs, a central dimerization domain, and a C-terminal metal-binding domain. The DNA-binding and dimerization domains are characteristic of the MerR family of proteins. The dimerization domain contains a 10-turn &alpha;-helix that forms an antiparallel coiled-coil with the helix of the other monomer. The metal-binding domain contains an unusual metal receptor site in which the bound metal is inaccessible to the solvent. The metal ion is bound with a linear coordination to two conserved cysteine residues. This dithiolate coordination confers the metal ion selectivity for +1 ions <a title="12958362" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Changela A,2003</a>. The sensitivity of CueR for copper(I) ions is extremely high (in the zeptomolar range), which corresponds to less than one atom per cell. Apparently it is the task of CueR and CopA to clear the toxic copper ions rapidly from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space <a title="12958362" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Changela A,2003</a>. It has been demonstrated that up to two Hg<sup>II</sup> ions bind with high affinity to WT CueR, one at the functional metal binding site (C112 and C120) and the other at the C-terminal CCHH motif. This motif provides a selection of ligands that could be participating in coordination of both soft and intermediate metal ions <a title="31365771" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Balogh RK, Gyurcsik B, Hunyadi-Gulyás É, Schell J, Thulstrup PW, Hemmingsen L, Jancsó A,2019</a>

ECK125336165	YgbI					ECK12	YgbI was predicted to be a DeoR-type transcription factor using the Hidden Markov Model |CITS: [34428301]|. YgbI DNA-binding activity was probed in vivo in glucose M9 minimal medium through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-exo), which identified a single binding region in between the <i>ygbI</i> and <i>ygbJK</i> divergent transcription units |CITS: [34428301]|. By RNA-seq of the wild-type and <i>ygbI</i> knockout strains, it was determined that transcription of <i>ygbJ</i> and <i>ygbK</i> is negatively regulated by YgbI |CITS: [34428301]|. In conjunction, ChIP-exo and RNA-seq studies indicated that <i>ygbJK</i> is a direct target of YgbI |CITS: [34428301]|.
