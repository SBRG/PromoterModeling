ECK125269239	ECK120011190	Rob	Rob is a transcriptional dual regulator. Its N-terminal domain shares 49% identity with MarA and SoxS |CITS:[8383113]|. These proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes |CITS:[10852879][12067348][14712652][11395452]|, the <i>marA/soxS/rob</i> regulon, involved in antibiotic resistance |CITS:[8636021][15853893][7896685]|, superoxide resistance |CITS:[8626315][1400156][1317841]|, and tolerance to organic solvents |CITS:[9324261][9783171][30976323]| and heavy metals |CITS:[7793951]|. The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS:[11844771][12791142]|, and the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate |CITS:[11395452]| and oxidative stress |CITS:[8955629]|, respectively. Cross talk between the <i>mar</i> and <i>rob</i> systems plays an important role in the response to salicylate |CITS:[22753060]|. <br>Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS:[14594836]|. <br>Rob, MarA, and SoxS bind as monomers to the same DNA site, a degenerate 20-bp sequence known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the  -35 and  -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|. In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the  -35 box and are generally oriented in the backward direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the  -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS:[10564485][10564484][22465792]|. As a subset of the class I promoters, the Mar-Sox-Rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the  -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|.<br>The Mar-Sox-Rob box contains an invariant A at position 1, two recognition elements, the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS:[10802742][11724537][11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS:[11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS:[11985714]|. It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named DNA scanning or prerecruitment. In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites |CITS:[11985714][11866462]|. <br>Rob consists of two domains and belongs to the AraC/XylS family |CITS:[9409145]|. The N-terminal domain is the DNA-binding domain and is homologous to MarA and SoxS and the C-terminal domain of AraC. It carries two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs for DNA binding. One of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the Mar-Sox-Rob box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with RE2 |CITS:[12217688][9724717][11724537]|. In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of the two HTH motifs makes base-specific contacts with DNA |CITS:[10802742]|.

Fis directly modulates several cellular processes, such as transcription, chromosomal replication, DNA inversion, phage integration/excision, and DNA transposition |CITS: [1484481][11278071]|. Fis is able to form topological barriers blocking supercoiling diffusion around some promoters |CITS: [31639222]|.<br>As a transcriptional regulator, Fis regulates the expression of many genes involved in translation (rRNA and tRNA genes), virulence, biofilm formation, energy metabolism, stress response, central intermediary metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, transport, cell structure, carbon compound metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, motility, and chemotaxis |CITS: [17768236][1484481][11555281]|. A transcriptome analysis has shown that transcription of approximately 21% of genes is modulated directly or indirectly by Fis |CITS: [18340041]|.  <br>Fis, together with proteins such as HNS, HU, IHF, and Dps, is one of the largest components of the nucleoid. A ChIP-chip analysis has shown that Fis binds to 894 DNA regions in the genome, which results in two sites of Fis per supercoiling domain. These regions include both intergenic regions and regions within genes, and not all genes to which Fis binds are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to Fis in maintenance of nucleoid structure |CITS: [18340041]|. The negative supercoiling of DNA in Fis, H-NS, and HU transcription factors modulates their 3D shape and determines their molecular dynamics |CITS: [28191853]|. The circular supercoiled DNA dynamically folds in particular higher-order structures (hyperplectonemes) |CITS: [28191853]|. DNA regulated by the NAPs (HU and Fis) directly or indirectly contributes to the symmetrical wave pattern of base-pair substitution (BPS) rate |CITS: [31266871]|. <br>Under optimal growth conditions, Fis is the dominant DNA-binding protein in the cell. Up to 60,000 copies of the protein can be found in a single cell under log phase, but it is nearly imperceptible in stationary phase (<100 molecules per cell) |CITS: [10515926]|. The binding of FIS along the DNA positively correlates with transcriptional propensity |CITS: [30904377]|. The main effect of FIS on high transcription appears to be on the chromosomal integration region instead of an effect on specific promoters to which it binds |CITS: [30904377]|. Fis bends the DNA between 40 and 90&deg; |CITS: [1484481]|. This bending stabilizes the DNA looping to regulate transcription and to promote DNA compaction |CITS: [17045294][9642081]|. <br>The crystal structure of Fis has been solved by several research groups |CITS: [11183780][1946369][1986310][9362499]|, and they have shown that this protein has an &alpha;-helical core of four helices (A to D). The C-terminal domain contains the C and D helices, forming a helix-turn-helix motif, characteristic of many DNA-binding proteins. The N-terminal domain has the A helix and a flexible &beta;-hairpin arm, which are involved in DNA inversion; this region appears to make contact with the DNA invertase Hin in the invertasome structure |CITS: [9362499][1484481]|.<br>As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, expression of <i>fis</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, Fis is autoregulated, induced by high supercoiling levels |CITS: [11029698]|, and regulated by both growth rate-dependent and stringent control systems that require the presence of a GC motif downstream of the -10 region |CITS: [1547...

There is intensive cross-regulation with the paralogous two-component system NarX-NarL |CITS: [12546643][8501030]|. Each of the sensors, NarQ and NarX, phosphorylates both NarP and NarL, leading to the activation of both proteins. In the absence of nitrate and nitrite, NarX and NarQ stimulate the dephosphorylation of NarL-P and NarP-P |CITS: [8051011][8473280]|. This reaction is specific, that is, NarP-P is only dephosphorylated by NarQ. The system discriminates between nitrate and nitrite. In the presence of nitrate both sensors phosphorylate NarL and NarP to the same extent. In the presence of nitrite, autophosphorylation of NarX is low and NarX acts primarily as a phosphatase for NarL-P |CITS: [9426129][9006026][10464202]|. In contrast, NarQ phosphorylates NarL and NarP in response to both nitrate and nitrite. Therefore, with nitrite, NarP-P is the major regulator, and with nitrate both NarL and NarP are functional |CITS: [10464202][10542156]|.<br>NarP consists of the N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain.

ECK125269246	ECK125257183	IHF	IHF, <b>I</b>ntegration <b>h</b>ost <b>f</b>actor, is a global regulatory protein that helps to maintain DNA architecture. It binds and bends DNA at specific sites. IHF plays a role in DNA supercoiling and DNA duplex destabilization and affects processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and the expression of many genes |CITS:[15102446][1447969][11827473]|.<br>To regulate DNA replication, IHF binds to three loci in DNA, named oriC (origin of replication), datA (prevents untimely replication initiations), and DARS2 (promotes exchange of ADP/ATP in DnaA protein) |CITS: [34475859]|.   Before DNA replication initiation, IHF binds to the oriC region in a DnaA box R1-dependent manner, and it is rapidly released from this site after replication initiation to bind to other loci |CITS: [34475859]|. There are two specific binding sites for IHF in the oriC region |CITS: [34475859]|.<br>IHF is highly abundant in the cell. Its total intracellular concentration varies with growth rate and is higher in exponential phase, with 6,000 dimers per cell, than in stationary phase (3,000 dimers per cell) |CITS:[10515926]|.<br>IHF acts mostly as an accessory factor, stabilizing a correct nucleoprotein complex. For example, IHF was originally found to be required for the site-specific recombination of phage &lambda; with the chromosome |CITS:[6251971]|. For this, IHF stabilizes the bending of the DNA to facilitate binding of the bivalent integrase molecules |CITS:[2544029]|. There are two distinct DNA-bending steps during site recognition by IHF. The fast-phase step entails nonspecific DNA bending, while the slow phase involves specific DNA kinking during site recognition |CITS:[29267885]|. As another example, IHF stimulates transcription at &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters. Here, IHF acts to facilitate the formation of the loop between the upstream bound activator and the &sigma;<sup>54</sup> holoenzyme |CITS:[2208275][1404379]|. <br>Like HU, IHF plays a role in polyamine-dependent DNA condensation. The binding to low-affinity sites and introduction of sharp bends in chromosomal DNA promote the formation of rod-like condensed structures in chromosomal DNA |CITS:[19132923]|. <br>The intrinsic curvature and flexibility of binding sites of IHF were investigated. The preference of IHF for intrinsically curved and flexible DNA suggest a positive role in bending the DNA, since genomic regions with higher curvature and flexibility are generally easy to bend |CITS:[29625128]|. The binding sites for IHF have high intrinsic curvature compared with flanking regions, and these are characterized by high structural flexibility  |CITS:[ 29625128]|.<br>IHF is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, IhfA (HimA) and IhfB (HimD, Hip), that share about 25% amino acid identity |CITS:[3305480]|. The structure of IHF bound to DNA has been solved |CITS:[8980235][9032076]|. It binds tightly to DNA regions of about 40 bp carrying the 13-bp consensus sequence with A/T-rich elements upstream of the core consensus sequence |CITS:[2205834][2972385][8650000]|.

It binds and bends DNA at specific sites. IHF plays a role in DNA supercoiling and DNA duplex destabilization and affects processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and the expression of many genes <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Swinger KK, Rice PA,2004. Freundlich M,1992. Dhavan GM, Crothers DM, Chance MR, Brenowitz M,2002</a><br>To regulate DNA replication, IHF binds to three loci in DNA, named oriC (origin of replication), datA (prevents untimely replication initiations), and DARS2 (promotes exchange of ADP/ATP in DnaA protein) <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kasho K,2021</a>.   Before DNA replication initiation, IHF binds to the oriC region in a DnaA box R1-dependent manner, and it is rapidly released from this site after replication initiation to bind to other loci <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kasho K,2021</a>. There are two specific binding sites for IHF in the oriC region <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kasho K,2021</a>.<br>IHF is highly abundant in the cell.

NarL activates expression of 51 operons in response to nitrate, mostly genes needed for nitrate respiration. NarL represses 41 operons involved in alternative respiratory pathways, such as fumarate reduction or fermentation of simple sugars |CITS: [16377617]|.<br>The response regulator NarL belongs to the LuxR/UhpA family |CITS: [2559300][2314271]| and is part of the two-component system NarX-NarL. There is intensive cross-regulation with the paralogous two-component system NarQ-NarP |CITS: [12546643][8501030]|. Each of the sensors, NarX and NarQ, is able to phosphorylate NarL and NarP, leading to the activation of both proteins. In the absence of nitrate and nitrite, NarX and NarQ stimulate the dephosphorylation of NarL-P and NarP-P |CITS: [8051011][8473280]|. This reaction is specific, that is, NarL-P is only desphosphorylated by NarX. The system discriminates between nitrate and nitrite. In the presence of nitrate both sensors phosphorylate NarL and NarP to the same extent. In the presence of nitrite, NarX phosphorylates NarP but acts primarily as a phosphatase for NarL-P |CITS: [9426129][9006026][10464202]|. In contrast, NarQ phosphorylates NarL and NarP in response to both nitrate and nitrite. Therefore, NarL mainly serves as a nitrate regulator and is only weakly phosphorylated in the presence of nitrite |CITS: [10464202][10542156]|.<br>NarL consists of the N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain.

Based on the results of an EMSA and an <i>in vivo</i> expression assay, it was determined that the NarL OD (output domain) function has discrepant activities between NarL OD linkers. In the absence or presence of linker, the helix 6 constitutively represses<i>frdA</i>, and the presence of the linker loop 5-6 reverses this repression |CITS: [26307095]|.

It was also shown in a footprint assay that the NarL OD recognizes sites around the <i>narG</i> promoter, and optimal binding activities are induced when the RD (receiver domain) is phosphorylated; therefore, NarL RD phosphorylation acts as an on-off switch for increasing the DNA-binding affinity |CITS: [26307095]|.

ECK125269255	ECK120012407	CytR	CytR, <b>Cyt</b>idine <b>R</b>egulator, is a transcription factor required for transport and utilization of ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides |CITS:[7715459][8596434][8022285][1715855][9466254][9767576][14499937]|. In addition, a role for CytR in carbon catabolism was recently suggested |CITS:[34620864]|.  <br>The repressor CytR and the activator CRP, two dimeric proteins, interact to form a complex repressor nucleoprotein in the intergenic region. When only CRP is bound to this promoter, it functions as an activator, and then, when CytR binds to DNA and to CRP, the activation is repressed because CytR masks an activating region of CRP that otherwise would contact the RNA polymerase to activate transcription  |CITS:[ 8736525][10766824][9086266][10320573][10766824][8764393][8816767]|.<br>The CytR protein cannot act alone; the synergistic DNA binding is increased by direct interaction with CRP |CITS:[1962841][2170326][1649947]|. However, footprinting analyses showed that the dimers of CytR are flanked or sandwiched by two dimers of CRP |CITS:[1655726][10766824][10347150][8969182]|. At times CytR also repositions CRP to alternative DNA-binding sites that are not functional for activation |CITS:[ 8736525]|. <br>Gavigan et al. (1999) and Perini et al. (1996) showed that CytR binds in tandem in the regulated intergenic region |CITS: [10347150] [8969182]|. On the other hand, in 1997, Pedersen and Valentin-Hanses showed that CytR binds to octamer repeats, GTTGCATT in either the direct or inverted orientation and preferably separated by 2 or 3 bp |CITS: [9155036][15313602] [9466254]|. For this reason the length of the CytR DNA-binding site is variable.<br> Gene induction occurs when the physiological inducer, cytidine, binds to the CytR regulator and when cellular cAMP levels are high. CytR senses and binds cytidine, and when this happens the cooperativity of CytR and CRP is interrupted and the expression of genes is induced |CITS:[1655726][1715855]|.<br>CytR belongs to the GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[1639817]|. Like the other members of this family, it has an N-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif for DNA binding and a C-terminal domain for dimerization, inducer binding |CITS:[1639817]|, and protein contact with CRP |CITS:[9215632]|. Between these two domains, CytR has a disordered sequence that provides the HTH motif with freedom of movement |CITS: [9155036][9466254]|, which would allow this protein to interact with octameric half DNA-binding sites that could be arranged as inverted or  direct repeats and with different lengths of spacer regions |CITS:[9466254][9155036]|.

ECK125269258	ECK120011306	PhoB-phosphorylated	PhoB is a dual transcription regulator that activates expression of the Pho regulon in response to environmental P<sub>i</sub>. The Pho regulon includes operons and genes whose products are involved in phosphorus uptake and metabolism |CITS: [8432742][8755861][17020555]|. Expression of the periplasmic binding proteins for peptide transport, OppA and DppA, is repressed by PhoB |CITS: [1478454]|.  <br>PhoB is a response regulator and belongs to the two-component system PhoR/PhoB. Under phosphate limitation conditions the inner membrane sensor kinase PhoR autophosphorylates. Subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to PhoB results in activation of PhoB |CITS: [2693738]|. When phosphate is in excess, autophosphorylation of PhoR is inhibited and PhoB-P is dephosphorylated. This negative regulation requires in addition to PhoR an intact Pst system and PhoU |CITS: [8691745]|. In the absence of PhoR, cross-regulation of PhoB by CreC or acetyl phosphate results in phosphorylation of PhoB in response to carbon sources |CITS: [1551836][2228961]|. <br>PhoB consists of two functional domains, the N-terminal receiver domain, which is phosphorylated, and the C-terminal output domain, which binds to DNA and interacts with the &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription |CITS: [8648643][8422984]|. The crystal structure of a subcomplex, which includes the &sigma;<sub>4</sub> domain of the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> factor fused with the RNAP &beta;-subunit flap tip helix, shows that the &sigma;<sub>4</sub> domain is recruited to the <i>pho</i> box promoters by PhoB and reorients the &sigma;<sub>4</sub> domain with respect to its binding site |CITS: [21829166]|. The output domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors |CITS: [9199401]|. Its activity is silenced by the receiver domain, and phosphorylation relieves inhibition |CITS:[11073900]|. The 3D structure has been solved for the receiver domain |CITS: [9878437]| and two constitutively active mutants of this domain |CITS: [17182055]|, as well as that for the output domain |CITS: [9016718]|.

The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS: [11844771][12791142]|, and the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate |CITS: [11395452][27098660]| and by oxidative stress |CITS: [8955629]|, respectively. SoxS was induced by tellurite (TeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) in a DNA microarray analysis |CITS: [25049169]|.<br> <br>Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS: [14594836]|.<br>SoxS, MarA, and Rob bind as monomers to the same DNA site, a degenerate 20-bp sequence known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|. In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the -35 box and are generally oriented in the backward direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|. As a subset of the class I promoters, the Mar-Sox-Rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS: [10564485][10564484]|.<br>The Mar-Sox-Rob box contains an invariant A at position 1, two recognition elements, the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS: [10802742][11724537][11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS: [11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS: [11985714]|. It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named DNA scanning or prerecruitment. In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites |CITS: [11985714][11866462]|. It has been shown that SoxS binds to the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of RNA polymerase (&alpha;-CTD), in particular, it interacts with amino acid residues lying in or near the DNA-binding determinant of &alpha;-CTD. Apparently, SoxS functions as a co-sigma factor and redirects RNA polymerase to promoters carrying a SoxS-binding site |CITS: [15465042]|. <br>A new interaction that also occurs via prerecruitment between &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4 of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and SoxS has been identified |CITS: [20595001]|. There is evidence for the existence of two types of interactions between SoxS and &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4, with one type being able to occur off-DNA (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex that scans the chromosome for SoxS-dependent promoters) and with the other one occurring on-DNA (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex residing at a SoxS-dependent promoter) |CITS: [20595001]|.

ECK125269276	ECK120011302	OxyR	OxyR, oxidative stress regulator, is the transcriptional dual regulator for the expression of antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress, in particular, elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide. The OxyR regulon includes genes involved in peroxide metabolism, redox balance, and peroxide protection by, for example, manganese uptake |CITS: [2256675][11443091][12100544][19400769]|. Moreover, OxyR activates the synthesis of the small, noncoding <i>oxyS</i> RNA. This allows OxyR to regulate as many as 40 additional gene products indirectly by affecting mRNA stability or translation efficiency |CITS: [9230301]|. OxyR acts as a repressor for its own synthesis in both the oxidized and reduced forms |CITS: [2471187][1864839]|.  Accordingly, point mutations observed in <i>oxyR</i> as a result of adaptive evolution under high iron conditions lead to increased expression levels of OxyR-regulated genes, also termed the OxyR i-modulon |CITS: [31651953]|. For more information on i-modulons, see |CITS: [31797920]|. In addition, expression of <i>oxyR</i> is positively regulated by cAMP-activated Crp protein during exponential growth and negatively regulated by RpoS when cells enter stationary phase |CITS: [9324269]|. Based on microarray assays, a new function as regulator of S-nitrosylation (a nitrosative stress regulon) under anaerobic conditions has been determined for OxyR |CITS: [22539721]|, and it is distinct from the OxyR regulon activated by oxidative stress |CITS: [22539721]|.<br>OxyR consists of 305 amino acid residues and is a member of the LysR family of bacterial transcription factors |CITS: [2471187][2511419]|. It is a tetramer in solution |CITS: [7868603]|. OxyR consists of two domains, the N-terminal domain, carrying a helix-turn-helix motif, and the C-terminal regulatory domain. A flexible linker connects both domains. The C-terminal domain contains the determinants for oligomerization and two redox-active cysteines, Cys199 and Cys208 |CITS: [7868603][15543158][12595552]|. OxyR functions as a reversible cellular redox switch. In the presence of 100 nM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, activation occurs by the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys208 |CITS: [2183352][15543158]|. It was determined that concentrations of >2 &mu;M extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> trigger the intracellular OxyR stress response, and >5 &mu;M begins to impair cell growth in minimal medium |CITS: [29550333]|. Consistent with this, in minimal medium dose-dependent growth retardation occurred in the wild type and in a Glucose Minimal Media Optimized Strain (GMOS), but no significant impact of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the growth profile of iron-evolved strains was noted, as overexpression of OxyR-regulated ROS-detoxifying genes rendered the strains tolerant to peroxide |CITS: [31651953]|. In contrast with activation, inactivation of OxyR involves reduction of the disulfide bond by glutaredoxin 1 and glutathione |CITS: [9497290]|. Oxidation is significantly faster than reduction, allowing for transient activation in a reducing environment |CITS: [10339558]|. OxyR is also activated under nitrosative stress; this reaction involves S-nitrosylation of OxyR on Cys25 in planktonic cells under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions |CITS: [8797819][33850153]|. A mutant in Cys25 causes an increment of biofilm formation |CITS: [33850153]|.<br>The crystal structures of the regulatory domain of OxyR in both its reduced and oxidized forms have been solved.

ECK125269277	ECK120011465	GadW	The transcription factor GadW, for <b>G</b>lutamic <b>a</b>cid <b>d</b>ecarboxylase, is negatively autoregulated and controls the transcription of the genes involved in the principal acid resistance system, is glutamate dependent (GAD), and is also referred to as the GAD system |CITS:[12446650][18808381][12730179][16980449][17660422]|. In addition, GadW also activates the transcription of  the central activator involved in the acid response |CITS:[17660422]|. The physiological inducer is unknown. Richard et al. proposed that GadW can sense intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, but the mechanism is not known |CITS:[17768258]|.<br>GadW is one of the regulators in the acid resistance system and is encoded by the unusual <i>gadXW</i> operon, which is located in the region called the acid fitness island |CITS:[18808381]|. This operon encodes two transcriptional regulators, GadX and GadW, both of which are members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[9409145][11282467][18808381]|. <br>The activities of GadW and GadX are indispensable upon entry into the stationary phase in response to acid pH  |CITS:[11976288][12446650]|. In addition, Tramonti et al. provided evidence that the transcription of the <i>gadXW</i> operon is regulated to a posttranscriptional level by a <i>gadY</i> small RNA |CITS:[18808381][15466020]|.<br>GadW is highly homologous to GadX (42%), and apparently both are capable of cross talk to regulate expression of the genes of this system |CITS:[18808381]|. Although little is known about the regulating mechanism of GadW, Tucker et al. proposed that this regulator and GadX have distinct molecular mechanisms |CITS:[12730179][16980449]|. These regulators form homodimers |CITS: [9409145]| and heterodimers |CITS:[12446650]| <i>in vivo</i>.<br>Currently, the  GadW/GadX-dependent circuit, involved in the GAD system, is under discussion and study. Tramonti et al. showed that GadX alone activates <i>gadA</i> and <i>gadB</i> promoters |CITS:[11976288]|; Ma et al. added to this regulatory interaction with the GadW protein, showing that it inhibits GadX and that in some cases it activates in the absence of GadX  |CITS:[12446650]|. Trucker et al. gave evidence that GadW can work as a coactivator of GadX or it can inhibit the GadX-dependent activation; they also provided evidence of more target genes for GadX/GadW regulation  |CITS:[12730179]|. Regarding these interactions, Tramonti et al. showed the direct GadX binding at promoters of the <i>gadB</i> (two sites) and <i>gadA</i> (four sites) operons |CITS:[11976288]|; also, Ma et al. showed that GadW forms a homodimer and that it also binds to the DNA of the <i>gadA</i> and <i>gadB</i> promoters  |CITS:[12446650]|. <br>As a member of the AraC/XylS family, this transcription factor is composed of two domains: the C-terminal domain (60% homologous to the C terminal of GadX), which contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs in the DNA-binding region, and the amino-terminal domain (30% homologous to the N terminal of GadX), which is responsible for dimerization |CITS:[9409145][8451183][12446650]|. <br>Tramonti et al. speculated that GadW binds in tandem to two directed repeat sequences, in the same orientation, in the  intergenic regions to activate or repress the transcription of the genes regulated |CITS:[18808381]|. The binding targets for GadW consist of 21-nucleotide-long directed repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs, called the GAD box, which is proposed to be the binding site for GadW and GadX |CITS:[12730179][12730179][18808381]|.

ECK125269282	ECK120012316	AraC-&alpha;-L-arabinopyranose	The <b>ara</b>binose regulator, AraC, is a transcription factor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in arabinose catabolism and transport. It coregulates with another transcriptional regulator, CRP; both are transcription factors involved in l-arabinose degradation. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of five operons related to transport, catabolism, and autoregulation of l-arabinose. Transcription of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, l-arabinose, binds to the AraC regulator. In the absence of glucose, cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC |CITS:[9409145][1744033][6319708][1400237][9600836][2231717][6377308]|. <br>AraC binds to five target sites in the <i>araB</i>p region. AraC binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the presence of arabinose, and it is absolutely required for expression of <i>araB</i>p |CITS:[2237403][3279415][2962192][3520549][8428590]|. AraC binding to the distal site (-123.5) has been shown to down-regulate expression of <i>araB</i>p and <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[1560456][3279415]|. <br>In the absence of arabinose, AraC is unable to activate <i>araB</i>p, but it regulates its own expression by repressing <i>araC</i>p and <i>araB</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[2237403][3279415][3520549]|. Arabinose triggers AraC-dependent activation of <i>araB</i>p and relieves AraC-dependent repression of <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[3279415][3520549]|. The <i>araBAD</i> operon is located upstream of <i>araC</i> and in the opposite direction.<br>In the presence of arabinose, this regulator activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoters, and the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5. The binding targets for AraC consist of 17-nucleotide-long direct repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[9409145][8980677]|. <br>The AraC regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer. It is composed of two domains. The solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain has been solved. It consists of two helix-turn-helix regions connected by an &alpha;-helix |CITS:[19422057]|. The N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and L-arabinose binding |CITS:[9409145][8451183]|. Its crystal structure |CITS:[9367758][9103202]| reveals that the sugar molecule is bound within a &beta;-barrel, buried by the N-terminal arm of the protein. It has been suggested that this N-terminal arm plays a key role in the regulation of the arabinose-dependent DNA-binding properties of the protein. In the absence of arabinose it interacts with the DNA-binding domain and constrains this domain, and it releases it in the presence of arabinose |CITS:[9103202][18561170][19815018]|. This interaction appears to be affected by a mutation in the interdomain linker |CITS: [21840981]|. Mutations at position 15 in the N-terminal arm of AraC do not activate transcription in the presence of arabinose, and this was confirmed by using a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, which revealed that preservation of the shape of the arm is critical to inducibility |CITS:[23150197]|.<br>A negative autoregulation network motif increases the input dynamic range of the arabinose system by coupling the transcription factor protein level to the input signal |CITS:[21749723]|.<br>Based on a study with a new fluorescent reporter-operator system (FROS) probe used with the MalI transcription factor fused to the mCherry fluorescent protein, the spatial positioning and possible colocalization of target genes regulated by the AraC protein were examined, and it was determined that the induction of gene expression with arabinose does not result in colocalization of AraC-regulated transcription unit...

A ChIP-chip analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis) revealed that NsrR regulates, in addition, genes involved in motility and/or biofilm development |CITS: [19656291]|. NsrR also appears to regulate &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-dependent genes in an RseA-independent manner |CITS: [17416652]|; NsrR also regulates genes involved in tellurate reduction |CITS: [33136147]|.<br>NsrR belongs to the Rrf2 family |CITS: [15458412]|, which includes among others the [2Fe-2S]-containing transcription factor IscR and the iron regulator RirA |CITS: [11742080][12480909]|. These proteins have orthologs in a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [16261196]|.

ChIP-chip studies (chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis) allowed identification of over 60 potential binding sites for NsrR in <i>E. coli</i>. The analysis of these sites suggests that there are two types of sites: those comprising two copies of an 11-bp inverted repeat with 1-bp spacing, as previously described, and those which have a single copy of the 11-bp motif. It should be noted that the 11-bp motif is itself a partial palindrome, and it has been suggested that the two types of site are occupied by NsrR in different oligomeric states |CITS: [19656291]|. The form of the protein that binds DNA specifically is that bound to a [2Fe-2S] cluster, but when NO binds to the cluster, NsrR loses its DNA-binding activity |CITS: [18989365][18658270]|. <br><i>nsrR</i> is the first gene in the <i>nsrR-rnr-rlmB-yjfI</i> operon; the second gene encodes an RNase that contributes to cellular  growth at low temperatures |CITS: [14622421]|, the third one encodes the 23S rRNA methyltransferase |CITS: [11698387]|, and no function has been assigned for the fourth gene.

ECK125269391	ECK125257202	RelB-RelE	RelB is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator which belongs to the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family of transcription factors |CITS:[14659018][17924660][18501926]| and it is an antitoxin that prevents the lethal action of the toxin |CITS:[9767574]|. RelB is part of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon, which specifies a toxin-antitoxin system, and it is autoregulated by its own products, RelB and RelE |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135]|. On the other hand, <i>relE</i> encodes a cytotoxin that is lethal or inhibitory to host cells |CITS:[9767574]|, and it also encodes a cofactor that enhances the repressor activity of RelB |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135]|.<br>The <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon is induced upon entering nutritional starvation conditions, such as the stringent response or acid starvation |CITS:[11717402][11972253]|, while the level of RelB antitoxin is reduced as a result of Lon-dependent proteolysis. Consequently, RelE toxin is liberated, leading to cell growth arrest and eventually cell death |CITS:[12603745]|. The expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon under these conditions may have some as-yet-uncovered beneficial function |CITS:[9767574]|.<br>RelB and RelE form a high-affinity complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry when RelB is in excess |CITS:[18532983][19747491]|. This interaction of RelE with RelB is essential for regulating the expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon and for neutralizing the toxic activity of RelE |CITS:[11274135]|. The ReB<sub>2</sub>-RelE complex represses transcription of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon |CITS:[18501926]| via strong cooperative binding to the <i>relB</i> promoter region |CITS:[9767574][19747491]|. The 24-bp operator contains a hexad repeat (5'-[A/T]TGT[A/C]A-3') that is repeated twice on each strand |CITS:[18501926][19297318][19747491]|. The spacing between each half-site was found to be essential for cooperative interactions |CITS:[19747491]| between two RelB<sub>2</sub>-RelE heterotrimers. Only RelB makes contacts to the DNA and the RHH motif of RelB recognizes the four hexad repeats within the bipartite binding site.

Distinct forms of DPD constitute the interconverting molecules family generally called autoinducer 2 (AI-2).

This regulator is located in the unusual <i>gut</i> operon, which contains two glucitol-specific transcription factors, GutR and GutM, that regulate this operon negatively and positively, respectively; both regulators control transcription of glucitol PTS permease |CITS:[3062173]|. <br>Expression of <i>gutM</i> is increased in the presence of glucitol and in the absence of glucose. Although GutM binding does not depend on the presence of glucitol, this compound appears to be necessary for derepressing <i>gutM</i>, perhaps by interacting with GutR |CITS:[3062173]|. To activate transcription, GutM recognizes DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. When this protein activates genes involved in glucitol transport and utilization, it appears to bind to their regulatory regions without a coeffector |CITS:[3062173]|. In addition, Yamada et al. suggested that the regulators GutM and GutR have contrary effects; in the absence of glucitol, GutR represses transcription of the <i>gut</i> operon, and in the presence of glucitol, GutR interacts with this carbohydrate to dissociate from DNA, causing increases of GutM in sufficient amounts to increase transcription of the <i>gut</i> operon |CITS:[3062173]|.<br>Deletion of <i>arcA</i> and <i>gutM</i> under three different antibiotics, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, significantly suppressed resistance evolution, which was not caused by epistatic interactions with mutations known to confer drug resistance |CITS:[32144279]|.
